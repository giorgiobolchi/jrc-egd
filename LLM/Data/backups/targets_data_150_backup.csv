TA1.3;Reduce by at least 55% net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, by 2030;"The at least 55% economy-wide net reduction objective is enshrined in the Climate Law as an overall ambition at the EU level. Specific legislation covering different sectors translates this into sectoral ambition levels which cumulatively achieve the -55% target. This corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 62% in the existing ETS compared to 2005, a 40% reduction in ESR, (this is now complemented by 42% reduction target compared to 2005 in the newly established ETS2). With the aim of ensuring strong emissions reduction in other sectors, the overall contribution of the LULUCF sector to EU’s economy-wide target of − 55% by 2030 is limited to a maximum of − 225 MtCO2e/year. Achieving the LULUCF sector target of -310 MtCO2e in 2030 will elevate the total EU GHG emission reduction to approximately 57% compared to 1990. The total net EU greenhouse gases emissions, including LULUCF, were reduced by 32.5% between 1990 and 2022 [21]. GHG emission reductions need to double in the current decade compared to the previous decades (see charts in the annexes).
According to the Member States’ own projections reported in 2023 under Article 18 of the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation, total EU emissions are expected to fall in 2030 by about 50% below the 1990 level when factoring in additional measures. This falls short of the at least 55% objective, but the Member States projections do not accurately capture the evolution driven by EU-wide instruments such as the ETS.
Reaching the -55 % objective further depends on delivery of ESR, which is not fully on track, as well as the related functioning of ETS2. In addition, the -55% objective assumes that the LULUCF sink is at least -225 MtCO2e. The agreed LULUCF commitment of -310 MtCO2e could even achieve -57%. However, the current development of the LULUCF sink is opposite to the targets, including natural disturbances that are expected to further increase with the ongoing climate change [27], [28]. If this negative development continues, the risk of not reaching the sink of –225 MtCO2 cannot be ruled out.
On the other hand, the implementation of the complete Fit for 55 legislative package is expected to reduce EU net greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2030, putting EU on track to exceed 2030 targets [29].
On the way to climate neutrality by 2050, the Commission adopted a Communica- tion [23] in February 2024 that launches the process of setting the 2040 climate target for the EU, in compliance with Art. 4.3 of the Climate Law. While 2040 targets are not yet set, it is clear that much of the transition to 2050 has to be realised
by 2040. Based on the recommended emission reductions of 90-95 % by 2040 compared to 1990, of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change advised, the Commission has recommended a net 90% GHG reduction target for 2040.
Both 2040 and 2050 targets require a much deeper transformation of the energy system, through large scale deployment of climate-neutral technologies that require high investment efforts with some technologies not yet deployed at market scale. While some of the current instruments will keep delivering reductions well beyond 2030 (notably the EU ETS but also CO2 standards for vehicles, ReFuelEU Aviation, FuelEU Maritime and the Fluorinated gas (F-gas) Regulation), there will be a need
to review, update and complete the legislative framework for the post-2030 period. This will include topics such as carbon capture, industrial carbon removals, and overall and sector specific emission reduction trajectories. In addition, larger emis- sion reductions in difficult-to-abate sectors like agriculture will be needed, along with a larger role for carbon removals, including utilising land as a carbon sink.";GHG emissions
TA1.7;"Reduce methane emissions by 35 to 37% compared to 2005 levels, by 2030
An EU Strategy to reduce methane emissions";"Methane emissions were 497.15 MtCO2e in 2005 and decreased to 394.37 MtCO2e in 2022, making a reduction of about 20.67%. However, acceleration is needed to reach at least a 35% reduction by 2030.
The largest source of methane emissions in the EU is the agriculture sector, accounting for more than half of the total emissions, followed by the energy and waste sectors. Within agriculture, almost all methane emissions are from livestock: 80% of the total stems from enteric fermentation and 18% from manure man- agement. Furthermore, the energy sector showed the highest decline in emissions, primarily due to the mitigation of fugitive emissions from fuels, including emis- sions from the extraction of solid fuels and those associated with oil and natural gas production and distribution.
Most methane emissions from the waste sector come from solid waste disposal.

TA1.9;"EU ETS. The contribution of the sectors covered by the existing EU Emission trading System (EU ETS) with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62% compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2% per year up to 4.4%), by 2030
Directive (EU) 2023/959";"The decreasing trajectory of the number of CO2 emission allowances is expected to lead to -62% less CO2 emission in 2030 compared to 2005 levels. EU ETS emissions fell by 47% between 2005 and 2022. The most important driver for the decrease in EU ETS emissions has been the power sector, due to a substantial in- crease in renewable electricity production (primarily wind and solar) at the expense of both coal and gas. The system covers the electricity sector, large industry, and since 2012, aviation (initially intra-European Economic Area, with an upcoming extension of scope). Since 1 January 2024, it has been expanded to include the maritime sector [30]. The 2023 greenhouse gas emission projections reported by the Member States to the EEA [15], [22] result in a reduction of ETS emissions of 55% to 59% (with existing measures – with additional measures projection) in
the ETS sectors in 2030. While these projections are short of the 62% target, it is important to note that, the ETS being an EU-wide market-based (cap and trade) instrument, this objective is not directly addressed by Member States specific policies and cannot be consistently and comprehensively covered by the individual Member States GHG emission projections.
Given that the ETS instrument is established and operational, and that the nec- essary technologies are both available and affordable, it is anticipated that the target can be achieved.";GHG emissions
TA1.10;"ETS2. Contribution of the buildings and road transport sectors of 43% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a combined cost-efficient contribution of 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005
Directive (EU) 2023/959";"The ETS2 is a new EU-wide cap-and-trade economic instrument that covers the CO2 emissions from the combustion of fuels in road transport, buildings, and other sectors (mainly smaller industries), excluding agriculture. Monitoring starts in 2025, with cap and trade applying from 2027. As such, it overlaps significantly with the ESR in terms of sectors covered, but important differences are that a) it is implemented at the EU level, rather than through Member State-specific policies, and b) it does not cover non-CO2 emissions, many of which are from the hard-to- tackle agricultural sector.
Between 2005 and 2022, the emissions covered by the ETS 2 fell by 16% according to own estimates of the JRC. However, since the ETS2 instrument is newly implemented and official reporting by Member States is not yet available, the progress cannot currently be evaluated.";GHG emissions
TA1.11;"ESR. Increased national targets in line with an EU- wide reduction of 40% in the ESR sectors compared to 2005. Member States contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030 with targets ranging from -10% to -50% below 2005 level (sectors: transport, buildings, agriculture and waste)
Regulation (EU) 2023/857";"The current (2022) reduction is 17% relative to 2005, far from the 40% reduction target set for 2030. Between 2013 and 2020, Member States met or overa- chieved their ESR obligations- with the largest reductions in the buildings and small industry sectors. Emissions are expected to continue decreasing in the com- ing decade due to –among others- source control legislation, such as improved building standards, building renovations, CO2 standards for road vehicles and EU policies on phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and other fluorinated gases. Progress in the transport and building sectors faces different challenges. While transport emissions are regulated by EU-wide CO2 emission standards for vehicles (which have a relatively fast turnover rate), renovating the building stock is a more challenging effort, primarily driven by Member States' policies. Therefore, Member States' projections for building emissions significantly lag behind the expected cost-effective rate of reduction [31].
Overall, EU emissions in the sectors covered by the ESR, according to 2023 Member States projections, are expected to fall by 27-32% (with existing and ad- ditional measures, respectively) by 2030 compared to 2005, i.e. 8 -13 percentage points below the 40% target for 2030, with only 6 Member States projected to (over-) achieve their targets [22].
Absolute emissions in the agriculture sector have stagnated since 2010, while agricultural aggregate output has increased, decreasing emission intensity of EU agricultural products by 13%.
Concerning emission reductions, current Member States' projections under the Governance Regulation foresee 2030 emissions with existing measures to be 373 MtCO2e (or -3% compared to 2021) and 359 MtCO2e (or -7 %) with additional measures. The 2030 ‘MIX (55 Euro/t CO2e)’ scenario, used to assess the Fit for 55 targets corresponds to a -7 % decline in the agricultural sector by 2030 compared to 2021, aligning with the Member States ‘with additional measures’ scenario. The current (2023-2027) CAP aims to contribute to climate mitigation, with Member State strategies outlined in their Strategic Plans. Estimates of the CAP 2023-2027 impact on emissions require detailed information on the implementation and effectiveness of farming practices from the CAP instruments, which are currently being evaluated.";GHG emissions
TA1.12;Achieve an EU net greenhouse gas removal of 310 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, by 2030, and Member State-specific targets for 2030 summing up to -42 MtCO2e increase in LULUCF sink between 2016-2018 and 2030.;"The revised LULUCF regulation sets a target of removing 310 MtCO2e by 2030. The long-term EU forest sink is developing away from this target and jeopard- ising the fulfilment of the overall LULUCF sector target for 2030. Furthermore, natural disturbances are expected to increase with ongoing climate change, with potentially a further reduction of the carbon sink, making the situation even more difficult.
In 2020, the gap between the reported LULUCF emissions in 2016-2018 and the target of -310 MtCO2e for 2030 was -42 MtCO2e for the EU. 2024 shows that this gap has now widened: instead of -42 MtCO2e, the EU needs to improve its LULUCF sink by -80 MtCO2e between 2022 and 2030 to meet the targets. The LULUCF targets will be difficult to achieve unless substantial changes in forest manage- ment are implemented very soon.";GHG removal
TA1.13;No debit rule. For the period from 2021 to 2025, each Member State shall ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from the sector do not exceed greenhouse gas removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals on its territory in all the land accounting categories. The accounting benchmark for the EU is ca. -229 MtCO2e/year for 2021-2025 LULUCF Regulation;"Assessing the distance to the target is difficult. Comparing purely the GHG re- porting from countries for 2021 and 2022, to the accounting benchmark of -229 MtCO2e determined by the delegated act, it looks like the EU is slightly exceeding the accounting benchmark. However, the recalculations of the inventories have increased the net sink historical time series reported by the Member States, and those recalculations will be considered in the accounting. Given the sharp decline of the forest sink driven by increasing harvest levels and natural disturbances, it is likely that the EU will face an overall accounting debit (i.e. not reaching the target) than a credit in the LULUCF sector as a whole.
The reporting for years 2026-2029 will be done in GHG inventories during 2028- 2031.";GHG removal
TA1.15;"Reduce buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, by 2030 (compared to 2015), and reach climate neutrality by 2050
A Renovation Wave for Europe";"In 2015 buildings direct GHG emissions were 541 MtCO2e, therefore the target value for 2030 is 216 MtCO2e.
European Climate Neutrality Observatory data shows past progress of 5 MtCO2e between 2016 and 2021. To meet the target, the required annual change between 2021 and 2030 needs to be 7.5 times faster than the past rate of progress. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40%
of the EU’s total energy consumption, and for 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions from energy (including indirect emissions). Buildings related emissions belonging to fossil fuelled district heating, electric heating and electricity use of heat pumps are covered by EU ETS, while the rest is covered by the ESR.";

Looking at city buses only, there has been a steady decrease in the number of new city buses fuelled by Diesel since 2016, increasingly being replaced by electric vehicles. A market growth average close to 18% could help achieve the 2030 target. This is feasible, given the 2020-2023 market trend (source: Rabobank). It should be finally noted that a collapse of the diesel buses market is unlikely (e.g. due to the need in rural areas), and new electrically chargeable buses accounted for 12.7% in the total EU bus market in 2022, making up only 1.4% of total buses on EU roads (source: ACEA).";

The use and risk of chemical pesticides shows a decrease of 6% from 2020 to 2021. These overall downward trends show that the target can be achieved by 20301. [182]
1 It should be noted that the current EU-wide indicator, which applies risk weightings to four different groups of chemical pesticides and is based on pesticide sales, is not considered scientifically robust by some. This indicator is based on a similar harmonised risk indicator, which, according to the European legislation (Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782), is considered hazard-based. This is due to the absence of statistics on the use of plant protection products needed to develop a risk indicator. The Commission is committed to developing more sophisticated indicators in future, such as improved weightings that take hazard properties into account in a more granular way or by using EU-level data on pesticide usage when it becomes available. An example of such an improvement is the new risk indicator assessing the toxicity of pesticide residues in soil from samples collected under the LUCAS Soil Pesticide survey coordinated by JRC. According to this indicator, in 2018, 14% of sites in the EU were at risk of negative effects on soil organisms due to pesticide residues. The analysis of samples from 2022 is currently ongoing and will shed light on the EU’s progress towards pesticide risk reductions.

It monitors the trend of F/FMSY at the level of European waters (Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea). The aim is to have a decreasing trend (as the starting point was 1.56) and to reach the lowest possible level below 1. A downward trend was observed throughout the time series, thus showing an improvement in the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks. Although the indicator

It has reached a record level in 2023, with a total surplus of EUR 70.1 billion. While the overall agri-food trade balance shows a surplus, there are variations at the category level. The EU has a trade deficit in several product categories, with the most significant deficits observed in oilseeds

However, the objective of achieving 100% coverage by 2025 is at risk at the current pace. Most Member States remain above the EU average of 73%. However, despite showing growth in the last decade, some Member States such as France (2013: 16%, 2022: 59%), Poland (2013: 18%, 2022: 40%), and Croatia (2013: >1%, 2022: 52%), still lag behind.";
TA5.22;Transport, accessibility and infrastructure: Create shorter supply chains will support reducing dependence on long-haul transportation.;There have been almost no changes in the number of tonnes transported across difference distance categories. Since 2013, approximately 30% of the freight of food products, beverages and tobacco has been transported less than 50 km, and another 30% has been transported between 50 and 150 km. Between 2013 and 2021, the tonnes per kilometre transported for all activities related to the food system (agriculture, fisheries, food manufacturing, trade and services) have increased by 9%, although the tonnes per kilometre transported in the food and beverages manufacturing sector decreased by 5%.

TA5.23;Employment and working conditions: Create new job opportunities. Improve working conditions, ensure occupation health and safety.;This indicator gives total employment in agriculture, the food industry and food services in absolute terms and also as a share of total employment. The employment in the food sector by economic activity has decreased over the last decade, from 8,474 (in 2013) to 6,326 (in 2022) million persons. During this period the mean annual decrease was 2.88% based on CAGR calculation, therefore around 25% of the employment moved out from the food sector in almost a decade. The share of total employment has also decreased, from 5% (in 2013) to 3% (in 2022). This negative trend indicates a move away from the objective, which aims at creating new job opportunities in the food sector. Indicator: Employment by economic activity (Source: Eurostat).;

TA5.29;Food availability: Improve availability of sustainable food. Ensure that the healthy option is always the easiest one. Ensure food supply.;"The ratio plant to total protein supply indicator is derived from FAO supply data. The closer the value is to 1, the higher the contribution of plant-based sources to protein supply, the average of the previous three years is taken to reduce error variation. This indicator examines the contribution of plant food sources
to total protein (animal and plant) supply and can inform on the transition towards more plant-based food diets based on food supply data. Since 2012, a slight decrease has been observed across most EU countries (between 1 and 5%). The average ratio for the EU region has slightly decreased from 0.42 to 0.40 between 2012 and 2020. This change indicates that a transition towards increased supply of plant-based foods in the EU remains a challenge, possibly linked to a slow progress in the transition towards more plant-based diets in the region. Indicator: Ratio plant to total protein supply (Source: FAO).";
TA5.30;Food affordability: Ensure affordability to sufficient, nutritious and sustainable food;The percentage of population who cannot afford a healthy diet is reported by FAO and the World Bank for global monitoring. A healthy diet is considered unaffordable when its cost exceeds 52% of income per capita per day. This percentage accounts for a portion of income that can be credibly reserved for food, based on observations that the population in low-income countries spend, on average, 52% of their income on food. The estimated proportion of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet in Europe has dropped 40% from 2.5% in 2017 to 1.5% in 2021. Across EU countries, values ranged between <1% for several countries and 7% in Romania in 2021. The indicator does not account for non-food spending and likely underestimates food affordability issues in the context of the EU region.

Among EU countries, values for 2022 ranged between 2% in Italy and 19% in Romania. Analysis of the trends indicate prevalence of food insecurity has slightly improved until 2019 but reversed in the last years. Indicator: Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the EU population (Source: FAO).;
TA5.33;Nutrition and healthy, sustainable diets: Move to healthier and more sustainable diets.;"EU diets are poorly aligned with dietary recommendations, as none of the EU Member States is on track to meet the dietary- related guidelines. In the EU, no country fulfils simultaneously the recommendations for healthy food consumption [185]: the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains nuts and seeds as well as milk and fish is lower than the recommended intake levels (when compared to either national food based dietary guidelines [186] or World Health Organization (WHO) and EAT-Lancet recommendations [187], [188]), while the consumption of red meat is above.
However, at the moment there is no adequate indicator available to assess the progress on this objective. The lack of regular, consistent and methodologically harmonised surveys across the EU Member States challenges the coverage and the comparability of such data, being an important gap for the use of these indicators. To overcome the lack of regularity and timeliness of the data, the development of food consumption indicators using data from national dietary surveys to monitor dietary components of healthy diets is being explored.";
TA5.34;Health impact of diets: Reversing of the rise in overweight and obesity rates across the EU by 2030;The indicator as reported in Eurostat indicates that the proportion of overweight adults in the EU has slightly increased from 51% in 2014 to 53% in 2019.

The Commission issued Guidelines [211]for defining, mapping, monitoring and strictly protecting EU Primary and Old-Growth Forests in 2023. However, there is still a lack of a clear, uniform definition of what constitutes primary and old-growth forests. As a result, while it is likely that the target will be met, it remains unclear whether all forests that should be protected will actually receive protection.;

Biodiversity Strategy
Target in common with the Farm to Fork Strategy and already assessed in Thematic Area 5trategy)";"Indicator: Use and risk of chemical pesticides (Source: DG SANTE).
According to a trend analysis by DG SANTE, the use and risk of chemical pesticides decreased by 14% between the baseline period of 2015–2017 and 2020. The use and risk of chemical pesticides shows a decrease of 6% from 2020, and an overall decrease in the first four years of observation of 33% from the baseline period of 2015-2017. These overall downward trends shows that the first part of the target can be achieved by 2030 [182]. On the other side, according to data published
by DG SANTE, the use of more hazardous pesticides fell by 21% between the baseline period of 2015–2017 and 2021. The use of more hazardous pesticides shows an increase of 5% from 2020 to 2021. Achievement of the 50% reduction target by 2030 remains challenging. It should be noted, while this indicator intends to monitor the use of the more hazardous pesticides, it does not take into account the exposure and hence the impact they might have on the environment and human health. In the future, this indicator should be complemented with a risk indicator showing changes in the actual risks.
1 It should be noted that the current EU-wide indicator, which applies risk weightings to four differ- ent groups of chemical pesticides and is based on pesticide sales, is not considered scientifically robust by some. This indicator is based on a similar harmonised risk indicator, which, according
to the European legislation (Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782), is considered hazard-based. This is due to the absence of statistics on the use of plant protection products needed to develop a risk indicator. The Commission is committed to developing more sophisticated indicators in future, such as improved weightings that take hazard properties into account in a more granular way or by using EU-level data on pesticide usage when it becomes available. An example of
such an improvement is the new risk indicator assessing the toxicity of pesticide residues in soil from samples collected under the LUCAS Soil Pesticide survey coordinated by JRC. According to this indicator, in 2018, 14% of sites in the EU were at risk of negative effects on soil organisms due to pesticide residues. The analysis of samples from 2022 is currently ongoing and will shed light on the EU’s progress towards pesticide risk reductions. This indicator is relevant to only one compartment (soil) but is just one of many being examined for usefulness and relevance. ";
TA6.10;7. At least 10% of agricultural area is under high-diversity landscape features Biodiversity Strategy;The JRC has developed an indicator [212] to monitor progress in the share of agricultural area covered by landscape features, showing that currently, at the EU level, 5.6% of agricultural land is covered by landscape features. However, this indicator does not capture high-diversity landscape features and no temporal trend is available, so at this stage no conclusion can be made regarding the likelihood to reach the target.;

The Regulation (EU) 1143/2014 (IAS Regulation) includes a set of measures to be taken across the EU in relation to IAS, aiming
to prevent, minimise and mitigate their adverse impacts. The implementation is underpinned by EASIN (European Alien Species Information Network), which also hosts the European early warning system on IAS of Union concern.

There are some examples of restoration measures already put in place across European Sea, but without an immediate implementation of NRL, as well as other directives (e.g. BDBS, WFD, MSFD), the EGD target would not be achieved Additional observation: As mentioned before, marine restoration can be achieved passively by no take MPA. Therefore, the increase in area that is fully protected would be a reasonable indicator of restoration. To the best of available knowledge, there is no evidence that part-protection works. Evidence of recovered species usually appear within five years but full recovery e.g. of urchin-kelp trophic cascades, may take 20 years.

'Nature Restoration Law'
Parallel target of the Biodiversity Strategy: “4. By 2030, significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored. Habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trends and status, and at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend”";After a steady decline over the period 1992-2010, common forest bird populations have stopped deteriorating and started showing some signs of recovery since 2010 [2], [207], [208]. Next data points for the common forest bird index will be crucial to confirm this recent increasing trend.;
TA6.50;"Reach no net land take
(EU Soil Strategy for 2030)";"Over the 2012-2018 period, the majority (78%) of the net land take happened in commuting zones. The net land take in urban areas during 2012-2018 amounted to 2.696 km2, corresponding to 450km2 annually. 1 415km2 or 47% of all land take took place in arable lands, impacting food security, carbon sequestration and the maintaining of biodiversity. The second largest land take took place
  in pastures — a loss of 945km2 or 36% of all land take. Pastures are among Europe’s most important biodiversity hotspots and soil carbon sinks.";
TA6.51;"Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that water intended for human consumption is wholesome and clean, by meeting several requirements related to micro-organisms and parasites which constitute a potential danger to human health and quality standards recalled in the Directive.
Directive 2020/2184 (‘Drinking Water Directive)";"The level of access to clean drinking water in Europe is high according to the WASH database by the WHO and UNICEF. However, as reported by the EEA,
the levels of treatment and accessibility are lower in rural areas than in urban locations. Disparities in access to safe drinking water among ethnic groups in Europe emerged as well. The revised Drinking Water Directive includes additional parameters than the 46 microbiological, chemical and indicator parameters of the first Drinking Water Directive. The new parameters include per- and polyfluorinated compounds and bisphenol A, setting limit values for their presence in drinking water. As of the end of 2022, EU level data on drinking water quality were still limited, with the latest data available dating from 2011 and 2013. The new directive also foresees a watch list mechanism for emerging pollutants.
The Directive’s Impact Assessment includes the calculation of the “SAPEA” Popu- lation Potentially at Health Risk indicator, estimating the share of the population that could potentially suffer from health problems because of the presence of contaminants in drinking water. According to the indicator, in 2015, 22.7 million people were potentially at health risk due to non-safe drinking water, equivalent
to 4 % of the EU population. The revised Directive is expected to positively impact drinking water quality. However, estimated data for 2015 is not sufficient to assess the status of drinking water quality with respect to its evolution over time and new additional parameters by the revised directive, as confirmed by the EEA. Member States have started complying with the reporting requirements in 2023.";
TA6.52;The Ambient Air Quality Directives set EU air quality standards for 12 air pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide / nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), ozone, benzene, lead, carbon monoxide, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, and benzo(a)pyrene. The Directives take into account relevant World Health Organisation standards, guidelines and programmes. The Directives also guide the assessment of air quality by establishing a representative high-quality monitoring network, with more than 4.000 air quality monitoring stations across the EU, and by exchanging reliable, objective, comparable information on air quality, including to a wider public. Where levels are elevated above limit or target values, Member States should prepare an air quality plan or programme to address the sources responsible to ensure compliance and to keep exceedance periods as short as possible. In addition, information on air quality should be disseminated to the public. ;In the European Union, air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk, causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that lead to the loss of healthy years of life and, in the most serious cases, premature deaths (about 240 000 reported in the European Union (EU) for 2021). Although emissions of air pollutants have been reduced over recent decades (primarily as a result of legislation), air quality remains a major concern in many parts of Europe. Air quality limits set by EU legislation for particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone continue to be exceeded, especially in many urban areas.;
TA6.62;"The Water Reuse Regulation aim to encourage and facilitate water reuse in the EU by harmonised minimum water quality requirements for the safe reuse of treated urban wastewaters in agricultural irrigation. Further requirements are set for monitoring, risk management, transparency and permits
on production and supply of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation
Regulation 2020/741 (‘Water reuse Regulation’)";Before the introduction of the Regulation, the EU was not equipped with a legislative framework for water reuse. More than 40,000 million m3 of waste- water is treated in the EU every year but only the 2.4% is further treated to be reused. As of April 2024, water reuse for agricultural irrigation is allowed in most Member States. Some Member States, where freshwater resources are abundant and irrigation demand is low, have planned not to allow water reuse for irrigation in their countries. Some Member States have not yet made a final decision, as resource and infrastructure costs still are being evaluated (source: WISE Freshwater website).;
TA7.4;"The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) aims
at preventing or reducing emissions from large industrial installations and intensive farming into the environment. The revised IED includes new provisions related to resource, energy and water efficiency and to the reduction of use and emissions of hazardous substances. The scope has been widened to include metal mining, batteries giga-factories, waste landfills and intensive farming. The revised IED contains also a set of measures to facilitate and accelerate the uptake of innovative techniques by industry.
Directive 2024/1785 on Industrial Emissions and the landfill of waste";The IED is a key instrument to support the transition of the EU industry towards a climate neutral, clean and circular economy. The revised legislation will lead to a considerable reduction of pollution from industry and level the playing field. For example, it is expected to deliver, latest by 2050, up to 40% additional reduction of key air pollutants.;
TA7.5;"The revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) extends the scope of the 1991 UWWTD to improve and maintain access to sanitation for all, in particular for vulnerable and marginalised groups, while aligning with the ZPAP and EGD climate and energy objectives.
This will be ensured by a number of new obligations on secondary treatment, now extended to all agglomerations with at least 1 000 population equivalent , by 2035. Member States will ensure the application of:
- Tertiary treatment, for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus (by 2039)
- Quaternary treatment, for the removal of a broad spectrum of micropollutants (by 2045)
These apply to larger plants of 150 000 p.e. (and above, with intermediate targets).
Directive concerning urban wastewater treatment";"Access to sanitation. There is a positive trend in the access to basic sanitation and connection to secondary wastewater treatment. Overall, the share of population without a bath, shower, or indoor flushing toilet in their household decreased from 2.2% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2020 [234]. However, in some Member States, there were still high shares of the population without access to basic sanitary facilities in 2020. The share of the EU population connected to secondary wastewater treatment has also increased continuously since 2000, reaching 81.1% in
2020 [234]. The revision of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive aims to bring additional improvements not only for water quality, but also for access to sanitation [235].
Secondary treatment. Small agglomerations constitute a significant pressure
on 11% of the EU’s surface water bodies [236]. Currently, the situation varies across the EU, with some Member States requesting all urban wastewater to be treated and others having set standards for small agglomerations beyond the requirements set in Directive 91/271/EEC [237].
Tertiary treatment. In many cases, nitrogen and phosphorus are well removed from wastewater, but there are still regions where additional removal could bring a significant benefit to the environment. In many cases, the costs of additional removal are well below the benefits that could be achieved, and some wastewater treatment plants operate already beyond the requirements of Directive 91/271/ EEC. The revision of the Directive aims to push nutrient removal further by imposing stricter standards. This would also contribute indirectly to the reduction of GHG emissions.
Quaternary treatment. While secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment
is being implemented compliant with Directive 91/271/EEC, several chemical micropollutants escape treatment plants and contribute to pollution of the receiving waters (e.g. pharmaceuticals and ingredients in personal care products). The revision of the Directive aims to require quaternary treatment for all larger plants, also based on an extended producer responsibility scheme that would help finance the corresponding treatment costs.";
TA7.6;Improve soil quality by reducing chemical pesticides’ use by 50%, by 2030;Considering soil quality and pesticides, reduction of (more hazardous) pesticide concentration in soil due to increased organic farming (as well as other agricultural practices) and other farm-to-fork objectives. Under current legal limitations (28 kg of copper per hectare over 7 years), a potential risk of increased organic farming could be an accumulation of copper in soil.;
TA7.8;Improve soil quality by reducing nutrient losses use by 50%, by 2030;"Considering water quality and nutrient losses, there is a possible reduction of nutrient inputs into marine ecosystems: nitrogen 32%, phosphorous 17%. 50% reduction of nutrient input could be achieved in four out of ten examined regions for nitrogen and in two out of ten for phosphorous. Source: Zero Pollution Outlook [218].
Considering water quality and chemical pesticides, and in particular chemicals load (diuron and terbuthylazine, as examples of low- and high-persistence chemicals, respectively) in water: 56% reduction in pesticides concentration can be achieved in shelf seas, 12% in open seas, depending on the persistence of the pesticide.

(2030 target contributing to the 2050 ambition of a toxic-free environment)";As a result of the revision to the new Ambient Air Quality Directive, it is likely that reductions by over 70%, compared to 2005 levels, can be achieved by 2030. Source: Zero Pollution Outlook [218].;
TA7.10;Improve water quality by reducing waste, plastic litter at sea (by 50%);Concentration of plastic litter at sea: 14% reduction of plastic litter (in 8% of the basin surface of the Mediterranean Sea and 44% of all beaches) with a total ban on single-use-plastic items. Source: Zero Pollution Outlook [218].;
TA7.11;Improve water quality by reducing microplastics released into the environment (by 30%);Microplastics concentration in soils is expected to increase, mainly due to the incorporation through the disposal of the sewage sludge and other agricultural practices such as plastics greenhouse, mulching films, drip irrigation, polymer-con- trolled release fertilisers and silage films. However, there is no harmonised methodology for their identification and quantification, and one should still be developed. The current database on soil pollution with plastics is still poor and no good prediction could be done. The EU has taken measures to combat microplastic pollution on all fronts (e.g. ban of certain single-use plastic products, restriction of intentionally produced microplastics and reduction of plastic pellet loss), aiming at reducing microplastic releases to the environment by 30% by 2030.;
TA7.13;"Reduce by 25% the EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity, by 2030 (compared to 2005) (2030 target contributing to the 2050 ambition of a toxic-free environment)
";Current and proposed EU policies do not appear sufficient to enable the EU to reduce the area of EU ecosystems under threat from air pollution by 25% in 2030 compared to 2005. Nonetheless, with the implementation of the recently revised of the Ambient Air Quality Directives, this target could be achieved. Source: Zero Pollution Outlook [218].;

Source: Zero Pollution Outlook [218].;
TA7.15;Having all soils in healthy condition by 2050;The EU Soil Health Assessment (see EUSO Dashboard) estimated that 60-70% of EU soils are not in healthy condition, in accordance also with other reports [196], [238]. 25% of the EU soils and 33% of EU Agricultural soils have soil erosion rates higher than sustainability ones. Soil erosion has decreased by around 10% in the period 2000-2016, but future trends are alarming due to climate change. Soil loss by water erosion is projected to increase by 13–22.5 % in EU and UK by 2050.;
TA7.16;"By means of an updated and harmonised list of pollutants affecting surface and groundwater,
updated existing quality standards, new monitoring requirements, improved and more accessible data, and a more flexible framework for addressing pollutants of emerging concerns, the proposal aims at setting new high standards for a series of chemical substances of concern to address chemical pollution in water. Proposal for a Directive amending the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive, and the Environmental Quality Standards Directive";"Micro-pollutants pose a significant challenge. The necessity of removing them
at wastewater treatment facilities increases treatment costs, and complete removal is not always feasible. The proposal encourages more proactive measures upstream by reducing emissions at their source. By avoiding water pollution, the proposal will also benefit the potential for water reuse. The enhanced watch list mechanism requiring Member States to monitor new substances, will enable
the Commission, with the support of the European Chemicals Agency and the Member States, to determine the need for additional or stricter quality standards. More frequent reporting of actual monitoring data, and its analysis by the EEA, will provide the EU Institutions, Member States, and the general public with a more precise and current understanding of the status of surface and groundwater bodies in the EU. The analysis of more regular monitoring and status data will effectively feed into the broader Zero Pollution Monitoring and Outlook framework";
