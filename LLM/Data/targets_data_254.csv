TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Reduction;TA1.10;The total quantity of allowances for the new emissions trading system should follow a linear trajectory to reach the emission reduction target for 2030, taking into account the cost-efficient contribution of the buildings and road transport sectors of 43 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a combined cost-efficient contribution of 42 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005.;This target is assigned to the GHG Reduction sub-theme as it specifically mentions emission reductions in various sectors.;"The ETS2 is a new EU-wide cap-and-trade economic instrument that covers the CO2 emissions from the combustion of fuels in road transport, buildings, and other sectors (mainly smaller industries), excluding agriculture. Monitoring starts in 2025, with cap and trade applying from 2027. As such, it overlaps significantly with the ESR in terms of sectors covered, but important differences are that a) it is implemented at the EU level, rather than through Member State-specific policies, and b) it does not cover non-CO2 emissions, many of which are from the hard-to- tackle agricultural sector.
Between 2005 and 2022, the emissions covered by the ETS 2 fell by 16% according to own estimates of the JRC. However, since the ETS2 instrument is newly implemented and official reporting by Member States is not yet available, the progress cannot currently be evaluated.";
TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Reduction;TA1.11;Upgrade national targets in line with an EU-wide reduction of 40% in the ESR sectors compared to 2005. Member States contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030 with targets ranging from -10% to -50% below 2005 level (sectors: transport, buildings, agriculture and waste);This target is assigned to the GHG Reduction sub-theme as it mentions an EU-wide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.;"The current (2022) reduction is 17% relative to 2005, far from the 40% reduction target set for 2030. Between 2013 and 2020, Member States met or overa- chieved their ESR obligations- with the largest reductions in the buildings and small industry sectors. Emissions are expected to continue decreasing in the com- ing decade due to ‚Äìamong others- source control legislation, such as improved building standards, building renovations, CO2 standards for road vehicles and EU policies on phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and other fluorinated gases. Progress in the transport and building sectors faces different challenges. While transport emissions are regulated by EU-wide CO2 emission standards for vehicles (which have a relatively fast turnover rate), renovating the building stock is a more challenging effort, primarily driven by Member States' policies. Therefore, Member States' projections for building emissions significantly lag behind the expected cost-effective rate of reduction [31].
Overall, EU emissions in the sectors covered by the ESR, according to 2023 Member States projections, are expected to fall by 27-32% (with existing and ad- ditional measures, respectively) by 2030 compared to 2005, i.e. 8 -13 percentage points below the 40% target for 2030, with only 6 Member States projected to (over-) achieve their targets [22].
Absolute emissions in the agriculture sector have stagnated since 2010, while agricultural aggregate output has increased, decreasing emission intensity of EU agricultural products by 13%.
Concerning emission reductions, current Member States' projections under the Governance Regulation foresee 2030 emissions with existing measures to be 373 MtCO2e (or -3% compared to 2021) and 359 MtCO2e (or -7 %) with additional measures. The 2030 ‚ÄòMIX (55 Euro/t CO2e)‚Äô scenario, used to assess the Fit for 55 targets corresponds to a -7 % decline in the agricultural sector by 2030 compared to 2021, aligning with the Member States ‚Äòwith additional measures‚Äô scenario. The current (2023-2027) CAP aims to contribute to climate mitigation, with Member State strategies outlined in their Strategic Plans. Estimates of the CAP 2023-2027 impact on emissions require detailed information on the implementation and effectiveness of farming practices from the CAP instruments, which are currently being evaluated.";
TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Removal;TA1.12;Achieve an EU net greenhouse gas removal of 310 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector;This target is assigned to the GHG Removal sub-theme as it specifically mentions net greenhouse gas removal.;"The revised LULUCF regulation sets a target of removing 310 MtCO2e by 2030. The long-term EU forest sink is developing away from this target and jeopard- ising the fulfilment of the overall LULUCF sector target for 2030. Furthermore, natural disturbances are expected to increase with ongoing climate change, with potentially a further reduction of the carbon sink, making the situation even more difficult.
In 2020, the gap between the reported LULUCF emissions in 2016-2018 and the target of -310 MtCO2e for 2030 was -42 MtCO2e for the EU. 2024 shows that this gap has now widened: instead of -42 MtCO2e, the EU needs to improve its LULUCF sink by -80 MtCO2e between 2022 and 2030 to meet the targets. The LULUCF targets will be difficult to achieve unless substantial changes in forest manage- ment are implemented very soon.";
TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Reduction;TA1.13;For the period from 2021 to 2025 each Member State shall ensure that greenhouse gas emissions  from the sector do not exceed greenhouse gas removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals on its territory in all of the land accounting categories (no debit rule). The accounting benchmark for the EU is ca. -229 Mt CO2e/yr for 2021-2025.;This target is assigned to the GHG Reduction sub-theme as it mentions limiting greenhouse gas emissions.;"Assessing the distance to the target is difficult. Comparing purely the GHG re- porting from countries for 2021 and 2022, to the accounting benchmark of -229 MtCO2e determined by the delegated act, it looks like the EU is slightly exceeding the accounting benchmark. However, the recalculations of the inventories have increased the net sink historical time series reported by the Member States, and those recalculations will be considered in the accounting. Given the sharp decline of the forest sink driven by increasing harvest levels and natural disturbances, it is likely that the EU will face an overall accounting debit (i.e. not reaching the target) than a credit in the LULUCF sector as a whole.
The reporting for years 2026-2029 will be done in GHG inventories during 2028- 2031.";
TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Reduction;TA1.14;Each Member State shall ensure that the annual sum of its greenhouse gas emissions and removals on its territory and in all of the land reporting categories, in each year in the period from 2026 to 2030, does not exceed the limit established by a linear trajectory, ending in 2030 on the target set out for that Member State(no debit rule);This target is assigned to the GHG Reduction sub-theme as it mentions limiting greenhouse gas emissions.;;
TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Reduce buildings‚Äô greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, compared to 2015 levels, by 2030;This target is assigned to the GHG Reduction - Buildings sub-theme as it specifically mentions reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings.;"In 2015 buildings direct GHG emissions were 541 MtCO2e, therefore the target value for 2030 is 216 MtCO2e.
European Climate Neutrality Observatory data shows past progress of 5 MtCO2e between 2016 and 2021. To meet the target, the required annual change between 2021 and 2030 needs to be 7.5 times faster than the past rate of progress. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40%
of the EU‚Äôs total energy consumption, and for 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions from energy (including indirect emissions). Buildings related emissions belonging to fossil fuelled district heating, electric heating and electricity use of heat pumps are covered by EU ETS, while the rest is covered by the ESR.";
TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Reduction;TA1.16;To achieve 55% reduction of GHG emission by 2030, methane emissions related to energy production and consumption should be reduced by 58% compared to the level in 2020;This target is also assigned to the GHG Reduction sub-theme as it mentions reducing greenhouse gas emissions.;;

TA1;TA1_Climate ambition;GHG Reduction;TA1.3;Reduce by at least 55% net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, by 2030;manual choice;"The at least 55% economy-wide net reduction objective is enshrined in the Climate Law as an overall ambition at the EU level. Specific legislation covering different sectors translates this into sectoral ambition levels which cumulatively achieve the -55% target. This corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 62% in the existing ETS compared to 2005, a 40% reduction in ESR, (this is now complemented by 42% reduction target compared to 2005 in the newly established ETS2). With the aim of ensuring strong emissions reduction in other sectors, the overall contribution of the LULUCF sector to EU‚Äôs economy-wide target of ‚àí 55% by 2030 is limited to a maximum of ‚àí 225 MtCO2e/year. Achieving the LULUCF sector target of -310 MtCO2e in 2030 will elevate the total EU GHG emission reduction to approximately 57% compared to 1990. The total net EU greenhouse gases emissions, including LULUCF, were reduced by 32.5% between 1990 and 2022 [21]. GHG emission reductions need to double in the current decade compared to the previous decades (see charts in the annexes).
According to the Member States‚Äô own projections reported in 2023 under Article 18 of the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation, total EU emissions are expected to fall in 2030 by about 50% below the 1990 level when factoring in additional measures. This falls short of the at least 55% objective, but the Member States projections do not accurately capture the evolution driven by EU-wide instruments such as the ETS.
Reaching the -55 % objective further depends on delivery of ESR, which is not fully on track, as well as the related functioning of ETS2. In addition, the -55% objective assumes that the LULUCF sink is at least -225 MtCO2e. The agreed LULUCF commitment of -310 MtCO2e could even achieve -57%. However, the current development of the LULUCF sink is opposite to the targets, including natural disturbances that are expected to further increase with the ongoing climate change [27], [28]. If this negative development continues, the risk of not reaching the sink of ‚Äì225 MtCO2 cannot be ruled out.
On the other hand, the implementation of the complete Fit for 55 legislative package is expected to reduce EU net greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2030, putting EU on track to exceed 2030 targets [29].
On the way to climate neutrality by 2050, the Commission adopted a Communica- tion [23] in February 2024 that launches the process of setting the 2040 climate target for the EU, in compliance with Art. 4.3 of the Climate Law. While 2040 targets are not yet set, it is clear that much of the transition to 2050 has to be realised
by 2040. Based on the recommended emission reductions of 90-95 % by 2040 compared to 1990, of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change advised, the Commission has recommended a net 90% GHG reduction target for 2040.
Both 2040 and 2050 targets require a much deeper transformation of the energy system, through large scale deployment of climate-neutral technologies that require high investment efforts with some technologies not yet deployed at market scale. While some of the current instruments will keep delivering reductions well beyond 2030 (notably the EU ETS but also CO2 standards for vehicles, ReFuelEU Aviation, FuelEU Maritime and the Fluorinated gas (F-gas) Regulation), there will be a need
to review, update and complete the legislative framework for the post-2030 period. This will include topics such as carbon capture, industrial carbon removals, and overall and sector specific emission reduction trajectories. In addition, larger emis- sion reductions in difficult-to-abate sectors like agriculture will be needed, along with a larger role for carbon removals, including utilising land as a carbon sink.";

However, the 2022 value is still below the expected annual average. In absolute terms, the gross final consumption
of renewable energy for heating and cooling purposes in the EU has gradually increased over time, mostly due to the contribution of biomass and heat pumps. However, a major push is required to meet the 2030 target.
Sweden led the way when it came to renewables in heating and cooling, with a 69.3% share, followed by Estonia (65.4%). Both countries use mostly biomass and heat pumps. They are followed by Latvia (61.0%), which relies mostly on biomass.";

Moreover, some Member States (e.g. EE, FI, IT and PT) plan to diversify their energy mix by carrying out joint hydrogen infrastructure projects [7]. Overall, Member States have made good efforts to increase cross-border capacity and the completion of various Projects of Common Interest should further improve the interconnectivity levels. Some Member States (CZ, IT, PT RO, SI, SE) are reporting delays in the completion of the projects in particular due to permitting issues.

The target could be partially achieved if the NRL is immediately implemented (including a clear financial system), along with the targets of the Biodiversity Strategy (i.e. 30% MPA and 10% strictly protected areas), and if Member States react in a timely manner.
The complete achievement of the target is strictly dependent on the restoration methods and selected marine ecosystems to be restored. The timescale of the recovery period varies as diverse are the marine habitats to restore. Beyond this there are other challenges that Member States have to face [205].
The actual implementation of the BDS target on effective marine protected areas (30% overall and 10% strictly protected by 2030), through passive restoration method, as well as the other directives (e.g. WFD and MSFD), and the 2023 Marine Action Plan would contribute to achieve this target.
Regarding the condition and restoration, there are only two ways to judge this: (a) comparison with old large fully protected MPA, and (b) the use of indicators, some of which still need to be developed.

There are some examples of restoration measures already put in place across European Sea, but without an immediate implementation of NRL, as well as other directives (e.g. BDBS, WFD, MSFD), the EGD target would not be achieved Additional observation: As mentioned before, marine restoration can be achieved passively by no take MPA. Therefore, the increase in area that is fully protected would be a reasonable indicator of restoration. To the best of available knowledge, there is no evidence that part-protection works. Evidence of recovered species usually appear within five years but full recovery e.g. of urchin-kelp trophic cascades, may take 20 years. Since restoration is by definition a return to fully natural conditions, partly protected areas do not qualify as restoration.

According to a trend analysis by DG SANTE, the use and risk of chemical pesticides decreased by 14% between the baseline period of 2015‚Äì2017 and 2020. The use and risk of chemical pesticides shows a decrease of 6% from 2020, and an overall decrease in the first four years of observation of 33% from the baseline period of 2015-2017. These overall downward trends shows that the first part of the target can be achieved by 2030 [182]. On the other side, according to data published
by DG SANTE, the use of more hazardous pesticides fell by 21% between the baseline period of 2015‚Äì2017 and 2021. The use of more hazardous pesticides shows an increase of 5% from 2020 to 2021. Achievement of the 50% reduction target by 2030 remains challenging. It should be noted, while this indicator intends to monitor the use of the more hazardous pesticides, it does not take into account the exposure and hence the impact they might have on the environment and human health. In the future, this indicator should be complemented with a risk indicator showing changes in the actual risks.
1 It should be noted that the current EU-wide indicator, which applies risk weightings to four differ- ent groups of chemical pesticides and is based on pesticide sales, is not considered scientifically robust by some. This indicator is based on a similar harmonised risk indicator, which, according
to the European legislation (Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782), is considered hazard-based. This is due to the absence of statistics on the use of plant protection products needed to develop a risk indicator. The Commission is committed to developing more sophisticated indicators in future, such as improved weightings that take hazard properties into account in a more granular way or by using EU-level data on pesticide usage when it becomes available. An example of
such an improvement is the new risk indicator assessing the toxicity of pesticide residues in soil from samples collected under the LUCAS Soil Pesticide survey coordinated by JRC. According to this indicator, in 2018, 14% of sites in the EU were at risk of negative effects on soil organisms due to pesticide residues.

This indicator is relevant to only one compartment (soil) but is just one of many being examined for usefulness and relevance. ";

Soil erosion has decreased by around 10% in the period 2000-2016, but future trends are alarming due to climate change.

The necessity of removing them
at wastewater treatment facilities increases treatment costs, and complete removal is not always feasible. The proposal encourages more proactive measures upstream by reducing emissions at their source. By avoiding water pollution, the proposal will also benefit the potential for water reuse. The enhanced watch list mechanism requiring Member States to monitor new substances, will enable
the Commission, with the support of the European Chemicals Agency and the Member States, to determine the need for additional or stricter quality standards. More frequent reporting of actual monitoring data, and its analysis by the EEA, will provide the EU Institutions, Member States, and the general public with a more precise and current understanding of the status of surface and groundwater bodies in the EU. The analysis of more regular monitoring and status data will effectively feed into the broader Zero Pollution Monitoring and Outlook framework";

There is a positive trend in the access to basic sanitation and connection to secondary wastewater treatment. Overall, the share of population without a bath, shower, or indoor flushing toilet in their household decreased from 2.2% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2020 [234]. However, in some Member States, there were still high shares of the population without access to basic sanitary facilities in 2020. The share of the EU population connected to secondary wastewater treatment has also increased continuously since 2000, reaching 81.1% in
2020 [234]. The revision of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive aims to bring additional improvements not only for water quality, but also for access to sanitation [235].
Secondary treatment. Small agglomerations constitute a significant pressure
on 11% of the EU‚Äôs surface water bodies [236]. Currently, the situation varies across the EU, with some Member States requesting all urban wastewater to be treated and others having set standards for small agglomerations beyond the requirements set in Directive 91/271/EEC [237].
Tertiary treatment. In many cases, nitrogen and phosphorus are well removed from wastewater, but there are still regions where additional removal could bring a significant benefit to the environment. In many cases, the costs of additional removal are well below the benefits that could be achieved, and some wastewater treatment plants operate already beyond the requirements of Directive 91/271/ EEC. The revision of the Directive aims to push nutrient removal further by imposing stricter standards. This would also contribute indirectly to the reduction of GHG emissions.
Quaternary treatment. While secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment
is being implemented compliant with Directive 91/271/EEC, several chemical micropollutants escape treatment plants and contribute to pollution of the receiving waters (e.g. pharmaceuticals and ingredients in personal care products). The revision of the Directive aims to require quaternary treatment for all larger plants, also based on an extended producer responsibility scheme that would help finance the corresponding treatment costs.";
