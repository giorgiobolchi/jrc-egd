TA1.1;Climate Neutrality (2040 target under discussion);TA2.1;+;Achieving climate neutrality will likely increase the demand for renewable hydrogen as a clean energy source, supporting the target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production.
TA1.1;Climate Neutrality (2040 target under discussion);TA2.9;+;The push for climate neutrality will drive the need for a higher share of renewable energy, aligning with the target of at least 42.5% renewable energy in the EU's gross final consumption by 2030.
TA1.10;The total quantity of allowances for the new emissions trading system should follow a linear trajectory to reach the emission reduction target for 2030...;TA2.13;+;Reducing emissions in buildings and transport sectors will encourage the use of renewable fuels, supporting the target of at least 29% renewable energy in transport by 2030.
TA1.11;Upgrade national targets in line with an EU-wide reduction of 40% in the ESR sectors compared to 2005...;TA2.16;+;Reducing emissions in ESR sectors will necessitate increased renewable energy use, supporting the target of increasing renewable energy in heating and cooling sectors.
TA1.12;Achieve an EU net greenhouse gas removal of 310 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector;TA2.18;+;Enhancing carbon sinks through LULUCF can complement efforts to increase renewable energy use in buildings, supporting the target of a 49% share of renewable energy in the building sector.
TA1.15;Reduce buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, compared to 2015 levels, by 2030;TA2.25;+;Reducing emissions in buildings aligns with the target to reduce buildings' final energy consumption by 14%, as both aim to improve energy efficiency.
TA1.16;To achieve 55% reduction of GHG emission by 2030, methane emissions related to energy production and consumption should be reduced by 58% compared to the level in 2020;TA2.19;+;Reducing methane emissions will support the transition to renewable and low-carbon energy sources in the fisheries sector, aligning with the target to reduce energy intensity.
TA2.1;Renewable hydrogen will be key to replace natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport...;TA1.3;+;The production and use of renewable hydrogen will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, supporting the target of a 55% reduction compared to 1990 levels.
TA2.9;Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union’s gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 42.5 %;TA1.3;+;Increasing the share of renewable energy will help achieve the target of reducing GHG emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels.
TA2.13;Each Member State shall set an obligation on fuel suppliers to ensure that...;TA1.7;+;The obligation to increase renewable fuels in transport will support the reduction of methane emissions by 35% compared to 2005 levels.
TA2.25;Reduce buildings' final energy consumption by 14%;TA1.15;+;Efforts to reduce energy consumption in buildings will complement the target to reduce buildings' GHG emissions by 60% by 2030.
