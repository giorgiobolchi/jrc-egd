TA1.4;Achieve a climate-resilient society status, fully adapted to the unavoidable impacts of climate change;TA3.8;+;A climate-resilient society will likely adopt circular economy practices, enhancing resource efficiency and reducing waste.
TA1.5;CBAM;TA3.9;+;The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism can encourage the use of recycled materials, supporting the circular economy.
TA1.6;Recast;TA3.10;+;Recasting policies can lead to increased recycling capacity, supporting the circular economy.
TA1.7;Reduce methane emissions of 35% if compared to 2005 levels;TA3.11;+;Reducing methane emissions can support the reduction of emissions in the circular economy, promoting sustainable practices.
TA1.8;Reach energy neutrality in the wastewater treatment sector by 2040. To reach energy neutrality and the additional treatment of nitrogen, GHG emissions would be reduced by 4,86 million tonnes (37,32 % of the avoidable emissions from the sector);TA3.12;+;Energy neutrality in wastewater treatment can support the circular economy by reducing emissions and promoting sustainable practices.
TA1.9;The contribution of the sectors covered by the EU ETS with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62 % compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2 % per year up to 4.4 %);TA3.13;+;Reducing emissions in sectors covered by the EU ETS can support the circular economy by promoting sustainable practices and reducing waste.
TA3.1;Halve the amount of residual (non-recycled) municipal waste;TA1.10;+;Reducing residual waste can contribute to emission reductions by promoting recycling and reducing landfill emissions.
TA3.2;Reduce landfill to a maximum of 10% of municipal waste;TA1.15;+;Reducing landfill waste can support emission reductions in buildings by promoting recycling and sustainable construction practices.
TA3.3;Double its circular material use rate in the coming decade;TA1.1;+;Increasing the circular material use rate can contribute to climate neutrality by promoting resource efficiency and reducing emissions.
TA3.4;By 2030 textile products placed on the EU market are long-lived and recyclable, to a great extent made of recycled fibres, free of hazardous substances and produced in respect of social rights and the environment;TA1.12;+;Sustainable textile production can enhance carbon sinks by promoting sustainable forestry practices.
TA3.5;By 2030 producers will have responsibility for their products along the value chain, including when they become waste. The circular textiles ecosystem is thriving, driven by sufficient capacities for innovative fibre-to-fibre recycling, while the incineration and landfilling of textiles is reduced to the minimum.;TA1.13;+;A thriving circular textiles ecosystem can support emission reductions by promoting recycling and reducing waste.
TA3.6;;TA1.14;+;Circular economy practices can support emission reductions by promoting resource efficiency and reducing waste.
