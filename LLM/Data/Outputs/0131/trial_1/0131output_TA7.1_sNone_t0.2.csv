TA7.22;The revision of the Ambient Air Quality Directives would merge the Directives into one, and seek to: align EU air quality standards more closely with WHO recommendations further improve the legislative framework (e.g. in relation to penalties, and public information)\nThe Directive sets out a zero pollution objective for air quality, so that within the Union air quality is progressively improved to levels no longer considered harmful to human health and natural ecosystems, as defined by scientific evidence, thus contributing to a toxic-free environment at the latest by 2050.;O - Public Administration and Defence, Compulsory Social Security;;;O84 - Public administration and defence, compulsory social security;;;O84.2 - Provision of services to the community as a whole;;;The target involves legislative and policy measures to improve air quality.;7
TA7.23;Remove micropollutants from wastewater. An additional treatment, i.e. quaternary treatment, should therefore be introduced in order to ensure that a large spectrum of micro-pollutants is removed from urban wastewater. All urban wastewater treatment plants of 100 000 p.e. and above should provide quaternary treatment. For agglomerations of between 10 000 p.e. and 100 000 p.e., Member States should be required to apply quaternary treatment to areas identified as sensitive to pollution with micro-pollutants based on clear criteria, which should be specified.;E - Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities;;;E37 - Sewerage;;;E37.0 - Sewerage;;;The target focuses on advanced wastewater treatment, aligning with sewerage activities.;9
TA7.24;Improve nutrient removal from wastewater.

TA7.5;The Ambient Air Quality Directives set EU air quality standards for 12 air pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide / nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), ozone, benzene, lead, carbon monoxide, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, and benzo(a)pyrene. The Directives take into account relevant World Health Organisation standards, guidelines and programmes. The Directives also guide the assessment of air quality by establishing a representative high-quality monitoring network, with more than 4.000 air quality monitoring stations across the EU, and by exchanging reliable, objective, comparable information on air quality, including to a wider public. Where levels are elevated above limit or target values, Member States should prepare an air quality plan or programme to address the sources responsible to ensure compliance and to keep exceedance periods as short as possible. In addition, information on air quality should be disseminated to the public.;O - Public Administration and Defence, Compulsory Social Security;;;O84 - Public administration and defence, compulsory social security;;;O84.2 - Provision of services to the community as a whole;;;The target involves setting and monitoring air quality standards, fitting with public administration activities.;7
