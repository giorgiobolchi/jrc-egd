GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biofuels;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in the energy sector can lead to an increased demand for biofuels, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. This can create a positive synergy between the two sub-themes.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9,TA4.32;Transport Logistics;-;The reduction of GHG emissions in the transportation sector can lead to a decrease in the demand for traditional transportation fuels, which can negatively impact the transport logistics sub-theme. This can create a trade-off between the two sub-themes.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Hydrogen Distribution;+;The implementation of GHG removal targets can lead to an increased demand for hydrogen, which can be distributed through the hydrogen distribution sub-theme. This can create a positive synergy between the two sub-themes.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Urban Mobility;-;The reduction of GHG emissions in the building sector can lead to a decrease in the demand for traditional energy sources, which can negatively impact the urban mobility sub-theme. This can create a trade-off between the two sub-themes.
Climate Resilience;TA1.3,TA1.6;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+;The implementation of climate resilience targets can lead to an increased demand for net-zero technology in the road vehicle sector, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This can create a positive synergy between the two sub-themes.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in the energy sector can lead to an increased demand for other low-carbon fuels, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This can create a positive synergy between the two sub-themes.
