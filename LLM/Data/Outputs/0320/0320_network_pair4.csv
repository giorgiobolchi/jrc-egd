GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets can positively influence terrestrial ecosystems restoration by promoting sustainable land use practices and reducing deforestation. This can lead to increased carbon sequestration and improved ecosystem health.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;-;However, the focus on GHG reduction might divert attention and resources away from marine ecosystem restoration, potentially hindering efforts to protect and restore marine ecosystems.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;The reduction of GHG emissions from buildings can have a positive impact on biodiversity protection and conservation by reducing the urban heat island effect and promoting more sustainable urban planning.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9,TA4.32;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-;The transition to low-carbon transportation can lead to an increased demand for biofuels, potentially competing with agricultural land use and hindering efforts to restore terrestrial ecosystems in agricultural areas.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;+;The implementation of GHG removal targets can promote the monitoring and protection of biodiversity, as it requires the preservation and restoration of natural ecosystems that absorb carbon dioxide.
Climate Resilience;TA1.3,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.3;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+;Climate resilience measures can have a positive impact on urban nature and biodiversity by promoting green infrastructure and urban planning that takes into account the needs of both humans and wildlife.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+;The reduction of GHG emissions can have a positive impact on fisheries and marine biodiversity by reducing ocean acidification and promoting more sustainable fishing practices.
