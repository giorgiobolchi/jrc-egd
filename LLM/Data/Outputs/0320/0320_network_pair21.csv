Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7,TA4.11;Food quality;+;The implementation of biofuels targets can lead to an increase in the production of bio-based products, which can positively impact food quality by providing sustainable alternatives to traditional fuels and promoting the development of new industries. This can also lead to the creation of new job opportunities and stimulate local economies.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7,TA4.11;Food affordability;-;However, the production of biofuels can also lead to an increase in food prices, as it may compete with food crops for land and resources, potentially negatively impacting food affordability, particularly for low-income households.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13;Food quality - Healthy Food;+;The development of net-zero technology for road vehicles can lead to a reduction in air pollution, which can positively impact public health and food quality by reducing the negative effects of air pollution on crops and food systems.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.6,TA4.8;Pesticides Reduction;+;The implementation of other low-carbon fuels targets can lead to a reduction in the use of pesticides, as these fuels can provide sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels and promote the development of new industries, which can positively impact the environment and human health.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.30,TA4.31;Competitive Agriculture;+;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure can lead to the creation of new job opportunities and stimulate local economies, particularly in the agricultural sector, which can positively impact competitive agriculture by providing new markets and revenue streams for farmers.
Urban Mobility;TA4.55;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+;The implementation of urban mobility targets can lead to a reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which can positively impact animal welfare by reducing the negative effects of air pollution on animal health and promoting more sustainable and humane farming practices.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA5.22;Food affordability;+;The development of sustainable transport logistics can lead to a reduction in transportation costs, which can positively impact food affordability by making food products more accessible and affordable for consumers, particularly in rural or remote areas.
