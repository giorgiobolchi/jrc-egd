Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.30;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;Reducing municipal waste can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, as less waste needs to be transported to landfills. This can contribute to the achievement of GHG reduction targets in the transportation sector.
Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.32;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;Increasing recycling rates of plastic and packaging materials can lead to a reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, as recycled materials often require less energy to produce than virgin materials.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;GHG Removal;-;The extraction and import of critical raw materials can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, which can negatively impact GHG removal efforts. This is because the production and transportation of these materials often rely on fossil fuels and can result in significant emissions.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies, such as electric vehicles, can contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. This can help achieve GHG reduction targets in the transportation sector.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA5.13;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;Reducing food waste can lead to a decrease in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, as less energy is required to produce, transport, and store food.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.13,TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;GHG Removal;+;The recycling of critical raw materials from batteries can help reduce the demand for primary materials, which can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This can contribute to GHG removal efforts and help achieve a net-zero economy.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;Increasing recycling rates and promoting circular economy practices can lead to a reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, as recycled materials often require less energy to produce than virgin materials.
