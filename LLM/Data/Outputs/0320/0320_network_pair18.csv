Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.5,TA4.7,TA4.55;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The implementation of biofuels targets in List A can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector, which is a key objective of the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme in List B. This is because biofuels can replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions from transportation.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The development and deployment of net-zero technology road vehicles in List A can support the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme in List B by reducing emissions from road transport. This can help achieve the targets set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.6,TA4.8;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The promotion of other low-carbon fuels in List A can contribute to the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme in List B by providing alternative fuels for transportation and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. This can help reduce emissions from the transport sector.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.30,TA4.31;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure in List A can support the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme in List B by enabling the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which can reduce emissions from transportation.
Urban Mobility;TA4.55;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The implementation of urban mobility targets in List A can contribute to the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme in List B by promoting sustainable transportation options and reducing emissions from urban transport.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA5.22;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The improvement of transport logistics in List A can support the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme in List B by increasing the efficiency of transportation and reducing emissions from the transport sector.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.5,TA4.7,TA4.55;GHG Removal;-;The production of biofuels in List A may compete with the use of biomass for carbon removal, which is a key objective of the GHG Removal sub-theme in List B. This could potentially limit the availability of biomass for carbon removal and negatively impact the achievement of GHG removal targets.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13;Climate Resilience;+;The development and deployment of net-zero technology road vehicles in List A can support the Climate Resilience sub-theme in List B by reducing emissions from transportation and promoting sustainable transportation options, which can help build resilience to climate change.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.6,TA4.8;Climate Resilience;+;The promotion of other low-carbon fuels in List A can contribute to the Climate Resilience sub-theme in List B by providing alternative fuels for transportation and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, which can help build resilience to climate change.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.30,TA4.31;Climate Resilience;+;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure in List A can support the Climate Resilience sub-theme in List B by enabling the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which can reduce emissions from transportation and promote sustainable transportation options, building resilience to climate change.
Urban Mobility;TA4.55;Climate Resilience;+;The implementation of urban mobility targets in List A can contribute to the Climate Resilience sub-theme in List B by promoting sustainable transportation options and reducing emissions from urban transport, which can help build resilience to climate change.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA5.22;Climate Resilience;+;The improvement of transport logistics in List A can support the Climate Resilience sub-theme in List B by increasing the efficiency of transportation and reducing emissions from the transport sector, which can help build resilience to climate change.
