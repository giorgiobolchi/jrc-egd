Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA6.51,TA6.62,TA7.10,TA7.11,TA7.16,TA7.5;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;Improving water quality can lead to a reduction in waste generation, as cleaner water reduces the need for single-use plastics and other pollutants. Effective wastewater management is also crucial for reducing municipal waste.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA6.51,TA6.62,TA7.10,TA7.11,TA7.16,TA7.5;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;Improved water quality can facilitate the recycling of municipal waste by reducing contamination and making it easier to process. This can lead to increased recycling rates and a more circular economy.
Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13, TA7.4, TA7.9;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+;Reducing air pollution can lead to a decrease in waste generation from plastic and packaging, as cleaner air reduces the need for single-use plastics and other pollutants. Additionally, improving air quality can increase the efficiency of waste reduction and recycling efforts.
Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13, TA7.4, TA7.9;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+;Improved air quality can facilitate the recycling of plastic and packaging waste by reducing contamination and making it easier to process. This can lead to increased recycling rates and a more circular economy.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.15,TA6.46,TA6.50,TA7.15,TA7.6,TA7.8;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;Improving soil health can lead to increased demand for critical raw materials, potentially straining extraction and import efforts. This could lead to trade-offs between soil health and critical raw material availability.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.15,TA6.46,TA6.50,TA7.15,TA7.6,TA7.8;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;Healthy soils can support the growth of biomass used in net-zero technology manufacturing, such as bioenergy and bioplastics. This can lead to increased production of sustainable materials and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
Noise Reduction;TA7.14;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;Reducing noise pollution can lead to increased efficiency in waste reduction and recycling efforts, as quieter environments can improve working conditions and reduce errors. This can lead to increased recycling rates and a more circular economy.
Noise Reduction;TA7.14;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;Improved noise reduction can facilitate the recycling of municipal waste by reducing distractions and improving working conditions. This can lead to increased recycling rates and a more circular economy.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA3.1,TA3.30,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Improved sanitation can lead to reduced food waste generation, as proper waste management reduces the risk of contamination and spoilage. This can lead to increased food security and reduced waste.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA3.1,TA3.30,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;+;Improved sanitation can facilitate the recycling of textile waste by reducing contamination and making it easier to process. This can lead to increased recycling rates and a more circular economy.
