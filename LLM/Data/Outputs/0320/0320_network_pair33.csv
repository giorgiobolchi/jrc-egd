Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.11,TA6.13,TA6.14,TA6.33;Urban Mobility;+;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased carbon sequestration, which in turn can support the development of urban mobility solutions that rely on low-carbon technologies. Additionally, restored ecosystems can provide ecosystem services that benefit urban areas, such as air and water filtration, which can improve the overall quality of life for urban residents.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA6.10,TA6.44,TA6.45;Biofuels;+;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can lead to increased biomass production, which can be used to produce biofuels. This can support the development of low-carbon transportation solutions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.40;Hydrogen Distribution;+;The restoration of forests can lead to increased carbon sequestration, which can support the development of hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure. Additionally, restored forests can provide ecosystem services that benefit the energy sector, such as water filtration, which can improve the overall efficiency of hydrogen production.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA6.1,TA6.28;Transport Logistics;+;The protection and conservation of biodiversity can lead to the preservation of ecosystem services that support transportation infrastructure, such as pollination and pest control. This can improve the overall efficiency and resilience of transportation systems.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.36,TA6.37,TA6.38;Urban Mobility;+;The protection and conservation of urban nature can lead to the creation of green spaces that support urban mobility solutions, such as pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. This can improve the overall quality of life for urban residents and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.30,TA6.41,TA6.42;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+;The restoration of marine ecosystems can lead to increased production of algae and other marine biomass, which can be used to produce low-carbon fuels. This can support the development of low-carbon transportation solutions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.39;Hydrogen Distribution;-;The restoration of rivers can lead to changes in water flow and quality, which can impact the efficiency and safety of hydrogen distribution infrastructure. This can increase the costs and complexity of hydrogen production and distribution.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA6.2,TA6.28;Biofuels;-;The protection and conservation of fisheries can lead to restrictions on the use of marine biomass for biofuel production, which can increase the costs and complexity of biofuel production.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.34,TA6.43;Transport Logistics;-;The monitoring of biodiversity can lead to the identification of areas that require protection, which can restrict the development of transportation infrastructure and increase the costs and complexity of transportation projects.
