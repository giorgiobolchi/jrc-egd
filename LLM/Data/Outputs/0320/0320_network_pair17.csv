Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.30;Improve Air Quality;+;Reducing municipal waste can lead to a decrease in air pollution, as waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration release harmful pollutants into the air. Improved waste reduction strategies can mitigate these effects, contributing to better air quality.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA5.13;Improve Water Quality;+;Food waste reduction can help decrease the amount of organic waste sent to landfills, where it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Additionally, reducing food waste can lower the demand for water-intensive agricultural practices, contributing to improved water quality.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.29;Improve Water Quality;+;Reducing plastic and packaging waste can decrease the amount of plastic debris entering waterways, mitigating the harm caused to aquatic ecosystems and improving water quality.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Improve Air Quality;+;Increasing recycling rates and improving waste management practices in municipal waste can reduce the need for incineration, lowering air pollution and contributing to better air quality.
Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.32,TA3.48,TA3.51,TA3.52;Improve Water Quality;+;Enhancing recycling and circularity practices for plastic and packaging can decrease the amount of plastic waste entering oceans and waterways, improving water quality and reducing harm to aquatic life.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Improve Soils Health;-;The extraction of critical raw materials can lead to soil degradation and pollution, negatively impacting soil health. Sustainable extraction and import practices are necessary to mitigate these effects.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Improve Air Quality;+;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies, such as renewable energy systems and energy-efficient devices, can contribute to reduced air pollution and improved air quality.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.13,TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Improve Soils Health;+;Responsible battery recycling practices can help recover critical raw materials, reducing the need for primary extraction and mitigating the associated environmental impacts, including soil degradation.
Waste Reduction;TA5.7;Social Security - Sanitation;+;Effective waste reduction and management practices can contribute to improved sanitation and public health, particularly in areas with limited waste management infrastructure.
Circularity/Recycling - Vehicle Circularity;TA3.38,TA3.49,TA3.50;Improve Air Quality;+;Promoting vehicle circularity through recycling and reuse can reduce the demand for primary materials, lowering the environmental impacts associated with extraction and processing, and contributing to improved air quality.
