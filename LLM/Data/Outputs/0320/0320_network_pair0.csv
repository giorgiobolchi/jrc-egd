GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets can lead to an increased demand for renewable energy sources, driving the growth of the renewable energy sector. This is because reducing GHG emissions often involves transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;The reduction of GHG emissions in buildings can be achieved through energy efficiency measures, such as retrofitting and insulation, which are also key components of the Energy Efficiency - Buildings sub-theme. This synergy can lead to cost-effective and environmentally beneficial solutions.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3, TA4.9;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;The transition to low-carbon transportation can be facilitated by the adoption of electric vehicles, which can be powered by renewable energy sources like solar energy. This connection highlights the potential for synergies between GHG reduction in transport and the growth of the solar energy sector.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;The production of renewable hydrogen can be energy-intensive and may compete with other renewable energy sources for resources, potentially hindering the achievement of GHG removal targets. This trade-off underscores the need for careful planning and management of renewable energy resources.
Climate Resilience;TA1.3;Energy Infrastructure;+;Investing in energy infrastructure that is resilient to climate change can help ensure a stable and reliable energy supply, which is critical for achieving climate resilience. This connection emphasizes the importance of integrating climate resilience considerations into energy infrastructure planning.
Methane;TA1.7;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;-;The production and transportation of renewable energy from offshore sources can lead to methane emissions, potentially undermining efforts to reduce methane emissions. This trade-off highlights the need for careful consideration of the environmental impacts of offshore renewable energy production.
