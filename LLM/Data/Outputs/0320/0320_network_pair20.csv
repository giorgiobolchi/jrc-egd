Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7,TA4.13;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;The implementation of biofuels targets may lead to an increased demand for critical raw materials, which could positively impact the development of recycling technologies for batteries. This, in turn, could enhance the recycling of critical raw materials used in biofuel production.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;The transition to net-zero technology in road vehicles may lead to an increased demand for critical raw materials, potentially straining global supply chains and negatively impacting the extraction and import of these materials.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.6,TA4.8;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;The development of other low-carbon fuels, such as synthetic fuels, may lead to a reduction in municipal waste, as these fuels can be produced from waste materials.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.30,TA4.31;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;-;The implementation of hydrogen distribution targets may lead to an increased demand for plastics and packaging materials, potentially negatively impacting efforts to reduce plastic waste.
Urban Mobility;TA4.55;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;The promotion of urban mobility, including zero-emission transportation, may lead to a reduction in food waste, as more efficient transportation systems can reduce food spoilage and waste.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA5.22;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;The development of more efficient transport logistics may lead to a reduction in municipal waste, as more efficient transportation systems can reduce packaging waste and increase the recycling of materials.
Rail;TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.41;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;The implementation of rail targets may lead to an increased demand for critical raw materials, potentially straining global supply chains and negatively impacting the extraction and import of these materials.
