Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13,TA7.4,TA7.9;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+;Improving air quality can have a positive impact on the health of forests, which in turn can support the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems. This is because air pollution can damage trees and other vegetation, so reducing pollution can help to create a healthier environment for these ecosystems to thrive.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA6.51,TA6.62,TA7.10,TA7.11,TA7.16,TA7.5;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+;Restoring rivers and improving water quality can have a positive impact on terrestrial ecosystems, as healthy rivers support a wide range of plant and animal species. This can in turn support the restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.15,TA6.46,TA6.50,TA7.15,TA7.6,TA7.8;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+;Improving soil health is critical for the restoration of agricultural ecosystems, as healthy soils support plant growth and can help to sequester carbon. This can in turn support the restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.15,TA6.46,TA6.50,TA7.15,TA7.6,TA7.8;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;Improving soil health can have a positive impact on biodiversity, as healthy soils support a wide range of plant and animal species. This can in turn support the protection and conservation of biodiversity.
Noise Reduction;TA7.14;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+;Reducing noise pollution can have a positive impact on urban nature and biodiversity, as excessive noise can disrupt the behavior and habitats of urban wildlife. This can in turn support the protection and conservation of biodiversity in urban areas.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA6.51,TA6.62,TA7.10,TA7.11,TA7.16,TA7.5;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+;Improving water quality can have a positive impact on marine ecosystems, as pollution from land-based activities can harm marine life and ecosystems. This can in turn support the restoration of marine ecosystems and biodiversity.
Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13,TA7.4,TA7.9;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;Improving air quality can have a positive impact on biodiversity, as air pollution can damage ecosystems and harm wildlife. This can in turn support the protection and conservation of biodiversity.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.5;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+;Improving sanitation and wastewater treatment can have a positive impact on fisheries and aquatic ecosystems, as pollution from wastewater can harm aquatic life and ecosystems. This can in turn support the protection and conservation of biodiversity in these ecosystems.
