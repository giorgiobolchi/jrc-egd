Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.30;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+;Reducing waste can lead to a decrease in the amount of waste sent to landfills, which in turn can help restore terrestrial ecosystems by reducing pollution and preserving natural habitats. This can also contribute to the restoration of rivers and forests, as well as the protection of biodiversity.

Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.30;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+;Implementing effective municipal waste reduction strategies can help decrease the amount of waste that ends up in rivers, reducing pollution and preserving aquatic ecosystems. This can also contribute to the restoration of rivers and the protection of biodiversity.

Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+;Reducing food waste can help decrease the environmental impact of agricultural production, such as the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and water. This can contribute to the restoration of agricultural ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity.

Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.29;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+;Reducing plastic waste can help decrease the amount of plastic that ends up in oceans, reducing pollution and preserving marine ecosystems. This can contribute to the restoration of marine ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity.

Circularity/Recycling;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+;Implementing effective recycling strategies can help decrease the amount of waste sent to landfills, reducing pollution and preserving natural habitats. This can also contribute to the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests and rivers.

Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.30;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+;Implementing effective municipal waste recycling strategies can help decrease the amount of waste that ends up in rivers, reducing pollution and preserving aquatic ecosystems. This can also contribute to the restoration of rivers and the protection of biodiversity.

Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.13,TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+;Recycling critical raw materials, such as those used in batteries, can help reduce the demand for primary materials, decreasing the environmental impact of mining and extraction. This can contribute to the restoration of forests and the protection of biodiversity.

Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+;Sustainable extraction and import of critical raw materials can help reduce the environmental impact of mining and extraction, preserving natural habitats and contributing to the restoration of forests.

Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+;Developing and manufacturing net-zero technologies can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity. This can also contribute to the restoration of rivers, forests, and marine ecosystems.
