Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.30;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;Reducing waste can lead to increased availability of materials for recycling and reuse, potentially reducing the need for primary materials in solar panel production, thus supporting the growth of the renewable energy sector. This can also lead to cost savings and increased efficiency in the production process.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.30;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;Implementing effective waste reduction strategies in municipal waste can lead to a decrease in waste sent to landfills, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the need for energy-intensive waste management processes, which can contribute to increased energy efficiency in buildings.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA5.13;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;Reducing food waste can lead to a decrease in the availability of organic waste for anaerobic digestion, which can be used to produce renewable energy in the form of hydrogen, potentially hindering the growth of the renewable energy sector.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.29;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;+;Reducing plastic waste can lead to a decrease in marine pollution, which can have a positive impact on offshore renewable energy installations, such as wind farms, by reducing the risk of damage from marine debris and supporting the growth of the ocean energy sector.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Energy Efficiency;-;Implementing circular economy practices can lead to increased energy efficiency in production processes, but may also require significant investments in new technologies and infrastructure, potentially increasing energy consumption in the short term.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.30,TA3.31,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;+;Increasing recycling rates in municipal waste can lead to a decrease in waste sent to landfills, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the need for energy-intensive waste management processes, which can contribute to increased energy efficiency in heating and cooling systems.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.13,TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Renewable Energy;-;Recycling critical raw materials from batteries can lead to a decrease in the availability of these materials for use in renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels, potentially hindering the growth of the renewable energy sector.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Energy Infrastructure;+;Increasing the extraction and import of critical raw materials can support the development of energy infrastructure, such as smart grids and energy storage systems, which are necessary for the integration of renewable energy sources into the energy mix.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA2.12,TA2.14,TA2.15;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;Developing net-zero technology manufacturing can lead to increased production of solar panels and other renewable energy technologies, supporting the growth of the renewable energy sector and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
