Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.5,TA4.7;Improve Air Quality;+;The implementation of biofuels can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants, thus improving air quality. This is because biofuels are a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.5,TA4.7;Improve Water Quality;-;The production of biofuels can have negative impacts on water quality due to the use of water-intensive crops and potential water pollution from agricultural runoff.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13;Improve Air Quality;+;The adoption of net-zero technology in road vehicles can significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, leading to improved air quality.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13;Improve Soils Health;-;The increased demand for minerals and metals required for net-zero technology could lead to soil degradation and pollution if not managed sustainably.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.6,TA4.8;Improve Air Quality;+;The use of other low-carbon fuels can reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to improved air quality.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.6,TA4.8;Improve Water Quality;-;The production and use of other low-carbon fuels may have negative impacts on water quality, such as water pollution from extraction and processing.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.30,TA4.31;Improve Air Quality;+;Hydrogen distribution and use can lead to a reduction in air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, thus improving air quality.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.30,TA4.31;Improve Soils Health;-;The extraction and processing of materials needed for hydrogen distribution infrastructure could potentially harm soil health if not done sustainably.
Urban Mobility;TA4.55;Improve Air Quality;+;Promoting urban mobility through cleaner transportation options can reduce air pollution and improve air quality in urban areas.
Urban Mobility;TA4.55;Improve Water Quality;-;Increased urban development for mobility infrastructure could lead to water pollution and degradation of water bodies if not properly managed.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA5.22;Improve Air Quality;+;Efficient transport logistics can reduce emissions and air pollution by optimizing routes and reducing fuel consumption.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA5.22;Improve Water Quality;-;The expansion of transport logistics infrastructure could result in water pollution from construction and increased risk of accidents involving hazardous materials.
