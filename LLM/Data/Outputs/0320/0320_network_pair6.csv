Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.13,TA2.15,TA2.16,TA2.2,TA2.23,TA2.37,TA2.39,TA2.5,TA2.7,TA2.9;GHG Reduction;+;The implementation of renewable energy targets in the Renewable Energy sub-theme is likely to positively impact the GHG Reduction sub-theme, as renewable energy sources emit significantly less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels, thus contributing to the reduction of GHG emissions.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.18,TA2.6;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;The promotion of renewable energy for heating and cooling in the Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling sub-theme can positively influence the GHG Reduction - Buildings sub-theme, as it reduces the reliance on fossil fuels for heating and cooling in buildings, leading to lower GHG emissions.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.40;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The development of renewable hydrogen production in the Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production sub-theme can positively impact the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme, as hydrogen can be used as a low-carbon fuel for transportation, reducing GHG emissions from the transport sector.
Energy Efficiency;TA1.8,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.41,TA4.10,TA4.19,TA4.32,TA4.33,TA4.34;GHG Reduction;+;The implementation of energy efficiency measures in the Energy Efficiency sub-theme is likely to positively impact the GHG Reduction sub-theme, as energy efficiency reduces energy consumption, which in turn reduces GHG emissions.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.33,TA2.34;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;The promotion of energy efficiency in buildings in the Energy Efficiency - Buildings sub-theme can positively influence the GHG Reduction - Buildings sub-theme, as energy-efficient buildings reduce energy consumption and lower GHG emissions.
Energy Infrastructure;TA2.17,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;The development of energy infrastructure in the Energy Infrastructure sub-theme can positively impact the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme, as it enables the widespread adoption of electric vehicles and other low-carbon transportation modes, reducing GHG emissions from the transport sector.
Methane;TA1.7;GHG Reduction;+;The reduction of methane emissions in the Methane sub-theme is likely to positively impact the GHG Reduction sub-theme, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and reducing its emissions can significantly contribute to the overall reduction of GHG emissions.
