Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.11,TA6.14,TA6.33,TA6.40;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;Restoring terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased waste reduction in municipal areas, as restored ecosystems can help filter and process waste more efficiently. This can also lead to a reduction in waste sent to landfills, aligning with the goals of waste reduction in municipal waste.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA6.10,TA6.44,TA6.45;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;-;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems may lead to increased demand for critical raw materials, such as those used in batteries, which could negatively impact recycling efforts and the development of a circular economy for these materials.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA6.1,TA6.3;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;Protecting biodiversity can limit the extraction of critical raw materials, potentially disrupting import and export markets and affecting the manufacturing of net-zero technologies.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.36,TA6.37,TA6.38;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Urban nature conservation can lead to increased urban agriculture and community gardens, reducing food waste by promoting local food systems and reducing transportation needs.

Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.30,TA6.41,TA6.42;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+;Restoring marine ecosystems can help reduce plastic pollution in oceans, which in turn can support the development of a circular economy for plastic and packaging materials.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.47;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;Restoring forests can provide biomass for energy production, supporting the development of net-zero technologies and manufacturing processes that rely on renewable energy sources.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA6.2,TA6.28;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;-;Fisheries conservation may lead to increased waste generation from fishing activities, potentially straining municipal waste management systems and affecting circular economy goals.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.34,TA6.43;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+;Monitoring biodiversity can help identify areas where plastic pollution is harming ecosystems, informing strategies to reduce plastic waste and promote a circular economy for plastic and packaging materials.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.39;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;Restoring river ecosystems can help improve water quality, reducing the amount of waste and pollutants entering municipal waste streams and supporting waste reduction goals.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA6.10,TA6.44,TA6.45;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Sustainable agricultural practices can reduce food waste by promoting efficient production and distribution systems, aligning with the goals of reducing food waste.
