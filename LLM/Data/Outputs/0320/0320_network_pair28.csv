Food quality;TA5.12,TA5.15,TA5.6,TA5.9;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;The implementation of targets related to food quality, such as reducing the environmental impact of food production, can positively influence biodiversity protection and conservation by promoting sustainable agricultural practices and reducing pollution. This can lead to a healthier environment and preserved ecosystems.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.2,TA5.25;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+;Improving animal welfare in the food sector can have a positive impact on biodiversity protection and conservation in fisheries, as it promotes more sustainable and responsible fishing practices, reducing the risk of overfishing and protecting marine ecosystems.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.29,TA5.30,TA5.32;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-;The pursuit of affordable food can lead to increased pressure on agricultural ecosystems, potentially resulting in deforestation, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity, which can negatively impact terrestrial ecosystems restoration efforts in agricultural ecosystems.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.4,TA5.5;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;Reducing pesticide use can have a positive impact on biodiversity protection and conservation, as it decreases the harmful effects of pesticides on ecosystems, allowing for the recovery of affected species and the preservation of ecosystem services.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.20,TA5.35;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+;Promoting competitive agriculture can lead to more sustainable and efficient farming practices, which can positively influence terrestrial ecosystems restoration in agricultural ecosystems by reducing the environmental impact of agriculture and promoting ecosystem services.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.27,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+;The promotion of healthy food can lead to increased demand for sustainable and locally sourced products, which can positively impact urban nature and biodiversity conservation by promoting green spaces, urban agriculture, and reducing the environmental impact of food systems.
