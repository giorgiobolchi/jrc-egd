Food quality;TA5.12,TA5.15,TA5.6,TA5.9;Renewable Energy;+;The implementation of sustainable food systems can lead to increased demand for renewable energy, driving the growth of the renewable energy sector. This is because sustainable food production often requires energy-efficient practices and renewable energy sources.
Food quality;TA5.12,TA5.15,TA5.6,TA5.9;Energy Efficiency;+;Sustainable food systems can also promote energy efficiency by reducing energy consumption in food production, processing, and distribution, which can lead to increased energy efficiency in buildings and industries.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.2,TA5.25;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;The promotion of animal welfare in food production can lead to increased adoption of solar energy in agricultural practices, such as solar-powered farming equipment and renewable energy-based livestock management systems.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.27,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;The focus on healthy food can drive the development of energy-efficient buildings and infrastructure for food production, processing, and distribution, which can lead to increased energy efficiency in the built environment.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.29,TA5.30,TA5.32;Social Security - Energy;+;Policies aimed at ensuring food affordability can have a positive impact on social security and energy access, particularly for vulnerable populations, by promoting affordable and sustainable energy solutions for food production and consumption.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.10,TA5.11,TA5.14;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;The reduction of pesticides in agriculture can lead to increased demand for alternative pest control methods, which may include energy-intensive solutions like hydrogen production, potentially straining renewable energy resources.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.20,TA5.35;Energy Infrastructure;+;The development of competitive agriculture can drive investment in energy infrastructure, including renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies, which can lead to increased energy security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.20,TA5.35;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;+;The growth of competitive agriculture can also lead to increased adoption of offshore renewable energy sources, such as wind and tidal power, which can provide a reliable and sustainable source of energy for agricultural practices.
