Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13,TA7.4,TA7.9;GHG Reduction;+;Improving air quality can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as air pollution is often linked to the same sources as GHG emissions, such as fossil fuel combustion. By reducing air pollution, we can also reduce GHG emissions.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA6.51, TA6.62, TA7.10, TA7.11, TA7.16, TA7.5;GHG Reduction;+;Improving water quality can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as water pollution is often linked to agricultural and industrial activities that also emit GHGs. By reducing water pollution, we can also reduce GHG emissions.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3, TA6.15, TA6.46, TA6.50, TA7.15, TA7.6, TA7.8;GHG Removal;+;Improving soil health can lead to an increase in carbon sequestration, as healthy soils can act as a carbon sink. By promoting soil health, we can also promote GHG removal.
Noise Reduction;TA7.14;Climate Resilience;-;Noise reduction measures may not directly contribute to climate resilience, and could potentially divert resources away from more critical climate resilience measures.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8, TA6.51, TA6.62, TA7.10, TA7.11, TA7.16, TA7.5;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;Improving water quality can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, as water pollution is often linked to shipping and other transportation activities that emit GHGs. By reducing water pollution, we can also reduce GHG emissions from transportation.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3, TA6.15, TA6.46, TA6.50, TA7.15, TA7.6, TA7.8;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;Improving soil health can lead to an increase in carbon sequestration, which can also reduce GHG emissions from buildings, as buildings are often constructed on soils that can act as a carbon sink. By promoting soil health, we can also reduce GHG emissions from buildings.
