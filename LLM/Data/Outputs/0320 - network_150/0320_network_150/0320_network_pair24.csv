Food quality;TA5.12,TA5.15,TA5.6,TA5.9;GHG Reduction;+;The implementation of targets in the 'Food quality' sub-theme, such as reducing the environmental footprint of food production, can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, thus supporting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme. This is because sustainable food production practices can lead to lower emissions from agriculture.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.2,TA5.25;GHG Reduction;+;Improving animal welfare in the food sector can lead to more sustainable and environmentally-friendly farming practices, which in turn can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme. This is due to the potential for more efficient and less resource-intensive farming methods.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.29,TA5.30,TA5.32;GHG Reduction - Transports;-;The 'Food affordability' sub-theme may have a negative impact on the 'GHG Reduction - Transports' sub-theme, as cheaper food options might lead to increased transportation emissions due to longer supply chains or more frequent deliveries. This could hinder efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.10,TA5.4,TA5.5;GHG Reduction;+;Reducing pesticide use in agriculture can lead to more sustainable farming practices, which can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme. This is because sustainable agriculture practices often involve methods that promote soil health and biodiversity, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.20,TA5.35;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;The 'Competitive Agriculture' sub-theme can positively influence the 'GHG Reduction - Buildings' sub-theme by promoting sustainable agricultural practices that can lead to the development of more energy-efficient agricultural buildings and infrastructure. This can include the use of renewable energy sources and green architecture in farm buildings.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.27,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;GHG Removal;+;Promoting healthy and sustainable food options, as outlined in the 'Food quality - Healthy Food' sub-theme, can support the 'GHG Removal' sub-theme by encouraging the adoption of diets that are not only healthier for individuals but also for the planet, potentially leading to the removal of greenhouse gases through reforestation or other carbon sequestration methods linked to sustainable agriculture.
