Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7,TA4.33;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;The production of biofuels may compete with the production of renewable hydrogen for the same feedstocks, potentially limiting the growth of the renewable hydrogen sector.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;The development of net-zero technology for road vehicles may increase demand for renewable energy sources like solar power to generate the electricity needed to power these vehicles.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.6,TA4.8;Energy Efficiency;-;The use of other low-carbon fuels may not be as energy-efficient as other alternatives, potentially limiting the overall energy efficiency gains in the transportation sector.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.30,TA4.31;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure is crucial for the growth of the renewable hydrogen production sector, as it enables the efficient transportation and storage of hydrogen.
Urban Mobility;TA4.55;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;The promotion of urban mobility may increase demand for renewable energy sources like solar power to generate the electricity needed to power electric vehicles and other urban transportation systems.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA5.22;Energy Efficiency;+;The optimization of transport logistics can lead to significant energy efficiency gains in the transportation sector, reducing the need for fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
Rail;TA1.2,TA2.5;Energy Efficiency;+;The development of rail infrastructure can lead to significant energy efficiency gains in the transportation sector, reducing the need for fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
