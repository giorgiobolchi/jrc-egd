GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Air Quality;+;Reducing GHG emissions can lead to improved air quality, as many GHG-emitting activities also release air pollutants. This synergy can be seen in the reduction of particulate matter and other pollutants.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Improve Air Quality;+;Building insulation and energy-efficient measures can reduce GHG emissions and improve indoor air quality, creating a healthier environment for occupants.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9;Improve Air Quality;+;Transitioning to cleaner transportation modes can reduce GHG emissions and air pollutants, improving air quality in urban areas.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Improve Soils Health;+;Afforestation and reforestation efforts for GHG removal can also improve soil health by increasing organic matter and reducing erosion.
Climate Resilience;TA1.3;Improve Water Quality;+;Climate-resilient water management practices can help maintain water quality by reducing the risk of flooding and droughts, which can contaminate water sources.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Soils Health;-;Intensive agriculture practices for GHG reduction, such as monoculture and increased fertilizer use, can degrade soil health and reduce biodiversity.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Noise Reduction;+;Energy-efficient building designs and materials can also reduce noise pollution by improving insulation and using quieter systems.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9;Noise Reduction;+;Electric and hybrid vehicles, promoted for GHG reduction in transport, generally produce less noise than traditional combustion engines, contributing to reduced noise pollution.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Improve Water Quality;+;Afforestation and reforestation for GHG removal can help maintain water cycles, reduce runoff, and protect water sources from pollution.
Climate Resilience;TA1.3;Improve Soils Health;+;Climate-resilient agricultural practices can enhance soil health by promoting practices like agroforestry, cover cropping, and organic amendments, which improve soil structure and fertility.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Social Security - Sanitation;-;The focus on GHG reduction might lead to increased costs for sanitation services, potentially affecting vulnerable populations' access to these essential services.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Social Security - Sanitation;+;Energy-efficient and climate-resilient building designs can include improved sanitation facilities, enhancing public health and social security.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9;Social Security - Sanitation;+;Clean transportation modes can reduce air pollution, which is beneficial for public health and can indirectly support better sanitation conditions by reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Social Security - Sanitation;+;Ecosystem restoration for GHG removal can also protect and improve water sources, which is crucial for sanitation and public health.
Climate Resilience;TA1.3;Social Security - Sanitation;+;Climate-resilient infrastructure, including sanitation facilities, can be designed to withstand extreme weather events, ensuring continuous access to essential services and enhancing social security.
