GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets can lead to increased demand for recycled materials, promoting circularity and recycling. This is because GHG reduction targets often involve the use of renewable energy sources, which can be complemented by recycling and circular economy practices.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;-;The reduction of GHG emissions from buildings may lead to increased waste generation from construction and demolition activities, potentially negatively impacting municipal waste management.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9,TA4.32;Circularity/Recycling - Vehicle Circularity;+;The transition to low-carbon transportation can drive the adoption of circular economy practices in the vehicle manufacturing sector, such as recycling and reuse of materials.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;The implementation of GHG removal targets may require the extraction and import of critical raw materials, potentially leading to environmental and social impacts associated with mining activities.
Climate Resilience;TA1.3,TA6.3;Waste Reduction;-;Climate resilience measures may involve the use of materials and resources that can contribute to waste generation, potentially negatively impacting waste reduction efforts.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets can drive the development and adoption of net-zero technologies, including those related to manufacturing and industry.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;The reduction of GHG emissions from buildings can involve the use of recycled materials and circular economy practices in construction, potentially reducing municipal waste.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9,TA4.32;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;-;The transition to low-carbon transportation may involve the use of single-use plastics and packaging materials, potentially negatively impacting waste reduction efforts.
