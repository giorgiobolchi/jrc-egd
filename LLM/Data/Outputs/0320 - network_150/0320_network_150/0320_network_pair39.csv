Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13,TA7.4,TA7.9;Urban Mobility;+;Improving air quality can lead to better health outcomes and increased mobility for citizens, which can be further enhanced by urban mobility solutions that prioritize clean transportation and reduced emissions. This synergy can create a positive feedback loop where improved air quality encourages more people to use urban mobility options, reducing emissions and improving overall quality of life.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA6.51, TA6.62, TA7.10, TA7.11, TA7.16, TA7.5;Hydrogen Distribution;-;Improving water quality may require significant investments in wastewater treatment and management, which could divert resources away from other critical infrastructure projects like hydrogen distribution. This trade-off could potentially slow down the development of hydrogen distribution networks, hindering the transition to cleaner energy sources.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3, TA6.15, TA6.46, TA6.50, TA7.15, TA7.6, TA7.8;Biofuels;+;Improving soil health can increase crop yields and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers, making biofuel production more sustainable and environmentally friendly. This can create new opportunities for biofuel production and contribute to a more diversified and resilient energy mix.
Noise Reduction;TA7.14;Transport Logistics;-;Noise reduction measures in transportation may require significant investments in infrastructure and technology, potentially diverting resources away from other critical transportation projects like transport logistics. This trade-off could slow down the development of more efficient and sustainable transportation systems, hindering the transition to a more competitive and low-carbon economy.
Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13,TA7.4,TA7.9;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+;Improving air quality can be achieved through the adoption of net-zero technology in road vehicles, which can significantly reduce emissions and improve public health. This synergy can create a positive feedback loop where improved air quality encourages more people to adopt net-zero technologies, reducing emissions and improving overall quality of life.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8, TA6.51, TA6.62, TA7.10, TA7.11, TA7.16, TA7.5;Rail;-;Improving water quality may require significant investments in wastewater treatment and management, which could divert resources away from other critical infrastructure projects like rail development. This trade-off could potentially slow down the development of more efficient and sustainable rail networks, hindering the transition to a more competitive and low-carbon economy.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3, TA6.15, TA6.46, TA6.50, TA7.15, TA7.6, TA7.8;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+;Improving soil health can increase crop yields and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers, making other low-carbon fuels like biogas and renewable natural gas more sustainable and environmentally friendly. This can create new opportunities for low-carbon fuel production and contribute to a more diversified and resilient energy mix.
Improve Air Quality;TA6.52,TA7.13,TA7.4,TA7.9;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+;Improving air quality can be achieved through the adoption of other low-carbon fuels like biogas and renewable natural gas, which can significantly reduce emissions and improve public health. This synergy can create a positive feedback loop where improved air quality encourages more people to adopt low-carbon fuels, reducing emissions and improving overall quality of life.
