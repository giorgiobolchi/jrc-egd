Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.11,TA6.13,TA6.14,TA6.33;Renewable Energy;+;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased carbon sequestration, which can positively impact the development and use of renewable energy sources by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. This synergy can enhance the effectiveness of renewable energy technologies.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA6.10,TA6.44,TA6.45;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;Restoring agricultural ecosystems can improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and enhance ecosystem services, which can lead to more efficient use of energy in buildings through the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices and the use of renewable energy sources.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.40;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;The restoration of forests can lead to increased competition for land use, potentially limiting the availability of land for hydrogen production facilities, which could negatively impact the development of renewable energy sources.

Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.30,TA6.41,TA6.42;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;+;Restoring marine ecosystems can improve the health and resilience of coastal ecosystems, which can positively impact the development and use of offshore renewable energy technologies, such as wind and tidal power.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA6.1,TA6.28;Renewable Energy;+;Protecting and conserving biodiversity can help maintain ecosystem services, which are essential for the development and use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, by ensuring the long-term health and resilience of ecosystems.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA6.2,TA6.28;Energy Efficiency;-;The protection and conservation of fisheries can lead to increased costs and regulations for the fishing industry, which could negatively impact energy efficiency efforts in the sector, such as the adoption of more efficient fishing gear and practices.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.36,TA6.37,TA6.38;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;Urban nature conservation can help reduce the urban heat island effect, improve air quality, and increase energy efficiency in buildings through the use of green roofs, urban forestry, and other nature-based solutions.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.39;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;Restoring river ecosystems can improve water quality, increase biodiversity, and enhance ecosystem services, which can positively impact the development and use of hydrogen production facilities, such as those using river water as a source of hydrogen.
