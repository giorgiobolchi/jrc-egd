Food quality;TA5.12,TA5.15,TA5.6,TA5.9;Circularity/Recycling;+;The implementation of food quality targets, such as reducing the environmental impact of food production, can positively influence circularity and recycling by promoting sustainable food systems and reducing food waste. This can lead to increased recycling and reuse of food waste, thereby supporting the circular economy.
Food quality;TA5.12,TA5.15,TA5.6,TA5.9;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Food quality targets can also reduce food waste by promoting sustainable food production and consumption practices, which in turn can decrease the amount of food waste generated and support waste reduction efforts.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.2,TA5.25;Circularity/Recycling;+;Improving animal welfare in food production can lead to more sustainable and circular farming practices, reducing waste and promoting recycling of organic materials. This can have a positive impact on circularity and recycling.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.27,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Promoting healthy food options can reduce food waste by encouraging sustainable food consumption patterns and supporting waste reduction efforts. This can also lead to increased recycling and reuse of food waste.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.29,TA5.30,TA5.32;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;-;Policies aimed at ensuring food affordability might inadvertently lead to increased food waste if they prioritize cheap food options over sustainable ones, potentially hindering waste reduction efforts.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.10,TA5.4,TA5.5;Circularity/Recycling;+;Reducing pesticide use can promote more sustainable and circular agricultural practices, leading to decreased waste and increased recycling of organic materials. This can have a positive impact on circularity and recycling.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.20,TA5.35;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;The pursuit of competitive agriculture might lead to increased demand for critical raw materials, potentially straining their extraction and import, and negatively impacting the circular economy and recycling efforts.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.20,TA5.35;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;On the other hand, competitive agriculture can drive innovation and investment in net-zero technologies, such as renewable energy and sustainable manufacturing, supporting the development of a more circular and low-carbon economy.
