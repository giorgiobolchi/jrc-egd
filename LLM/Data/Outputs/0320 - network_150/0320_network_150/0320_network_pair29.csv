Food quality;TA5.12,TA5.15,TA5.6,TA5.9,TA5.35;Improve Water Quality;+;The improvement of food quality through reduced pesticide use and increased organic farming can lead to better water quality, as pesticides and fertilizers are significant pollutants of water bodies. This synergy can enhance the overall environmental sustainability of the food system.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.2,TA5.25;Improve Air Quality;+;Enhanced animal welfare in food production can lead to reduced ammonia emissions from livestock, contributing to improved air quality. This connection highlights the interlinkages between animal welfare, air quality, and the broader environmental impact of the food sector.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.29,TA5.30,TA5.32;Improve Soils Health;-;Policies aimed at improving food affordability might inadvertently lead to increased pressure on soil health due to intensified agricultural practices to meet demand, potentially undermining efforts to improve soil quality. This trade-off underscores the need for balanced policies that consider both social and environmental dimensions.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.10,TA5.4,TA5.5;Improve Water Quality;+;Reducing pesticide use can directly improve water quality by decreasing the amount of chemical pollutants entering water bodies. This is a key synergy between pesticide reduction targets and water quality improvement objectives.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.20,TA5.35;Noise Reduction;+;Promoting competitive agriculture through sustainable practices can lead to reduced noise pollution from agricultural activities, contributing to a quieter environment. This positive impact is often overlooked but is an important aspect of sustainable agriculture.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.27,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;Improve Air Quality;+;Healthy food initiatives can promote dietary changes that reduce the demand for resource-intensive and polluting food production methods, indirectly contributing to improved air quality. This connection emphasizes the role of consumer choices in driving environmental sustainability.
