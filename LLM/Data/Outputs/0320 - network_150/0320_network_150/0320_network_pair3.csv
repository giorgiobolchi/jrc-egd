GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Food quality;+;The reduction of GHG emissions in the agriculture sector can lead to improved food quality by reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which can contaminate food products. This can also promote more sustainable agricultural practices, resulting in healthier and more nutritious food.

GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Food affordability;-;The implementation of energy-efficient measures in buildings can lead to increased costs for low-income households, potentially affecting their ability to afford food. This can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, making it more challenging for vulnerable populations to access nutritious food.

GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9,TA4.32,TA4.33,TA4.34;Food affordability;-;The transition to low-carbon transportation can lead to increased costs for food transportation, potentially affecting food prices and affordability. This can have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, which may already struggle to access affordable and nutritious food.

GHG Removal;TA1.12;Competitive Agriculture;+;The implementation of GHG removal technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, can support the development of competitive and sustainable agriculture. By reducing the carbon footprint of agricultural activities, farmers and agricultural businesses can improve their competitiveness in the market and contribute to a more sustainable food system.

GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Competitive Agriculture;+;The reduction of GHG emissions in the agriculture sector can lead to improved competitiveness by promoting more sustainable and efficient agricultural practices. This can result in cost savings, increased productivity, and better market access, ultimately supporting the development of a more competitive and sustainable agricultural sector.

GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.10,TA1.15;Pesticides Reduction;+;The implementation of energy-efficient measures in buildings can lead to reduced energy consumption, which can also reduce the need for pesticides and other chemicals in agricultural activities. This can promote more sustainable agricultural practices, resulting in reduced environmental pollution and improved public health.

GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.15,TA4.3,TA4.9,TA4.32,TA4.33,TA4.34;Pesticides Reduction;+;The transition to low-carbon transportation can lead to reduced emissions and pollution, which can also reduce the need for pesticides and other chemicals in agricultural activities. This can promote more sustainable agricultural practices, resulting in reduced environmental pollution and improved public health.

GHG Removal;TA1.12;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+;The implementation of GHG removal technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, can support the development of more sustainable and humane animal farming practices. By reducing the carbon footprint of agricultural activities, farmers and agricultural businesses can improve animal welfare and contribute to a more sustainable food system.

GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Food quality - Healthy Food;+;The reduction of GHG emissions in the agriculture sector can lead to improved food quality by promoting more sustainable agricultural practices, resulting in healthier and more nutritious food. This can also support the development of more sustainable and resilient food systems, which can provide better access to healthy and nutritious food.
