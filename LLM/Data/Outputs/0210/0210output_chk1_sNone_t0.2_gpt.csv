TA1.1;The contribution of the sectors covered by the EU ETS with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62 % compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2 % per year up to 4.4 %);D - Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply;C - Manufacturing;H - Transportation and Storage;D35 - Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply;C29 - Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers;H49 - Land transport and transport via pipelines;D35.1 - Electric power generation, transmission and distribution;C29.1 - Manufacture of motor vehicles;H49.5 - Transport via pipeline;The EU ETS covers multiple sectors including electricity, manufacturing, and transportation, which are significant contributors to emissions.;8
TA1.10;The total quantity of allowances for the new emissions trading system should follow a linear trajectory to reach the emission reduction target for 2030, taking into account the cost-efficient contribution of the buildings and road transport sectors of 43 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a combined cost-efficient contribution of 42 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005.;F - Construction;H - Transportation and Storage;D - Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply;F41 - Construction of buildings;H49 - Land transport and transport via pipelines;D35 - Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply;F41.2 - Construction of residential and non-residential buildings;H49.3 - Other passenger land transport;D35.1 - Electric power generation, transmission and distribution;The target involves emissions reductions in buildings and road transport, implicating construction, transportation, and energy sectors.;9
TA1.11;Upgrade national targets in line with an EU-wide reduction of 40% in the ESR sectors compared to 2005. Member States contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030 with targets ranging from -10% to -50% below 2005 level (sectors: transport, buildings, agriculture and waste);A - Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing;F - Construction;H - Transportation and Storage;A1 - Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities;F41 - Construction of buildings;H49 - Land transport and transport via pipelines;A1.1 - Growing of non-perennial crops;F41.2 - Construction of residential and non-residential buildings;H49.3 - Other passenger land transport;The target involves multiple sectors including agriculture, construction, and transportation, which are key contributors to emissions.;8
TA1.12;Achieve an EU net greenhouse gas removal of 310 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector;A - Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing;E - Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities;;A2 - Forestry and logging;E39 - Remediation activities and other waste management services;;A2.1 - Silviculture and other forestry activities;E39.0 - Remediation activities and other waste management services;;The target is focused on the LULUCF sector, which primarily involves forestry and related activities.;9
TA1.13;For the period from 2021 to 2025 each Member State shall ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from the sector do not exceed greenhouse gas removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals on its territory in all of the land accounting categories (no debit rule). The accounting benchmark for the EU is ca. -229 Mt CO2e/yr for 2021-2025.;A - Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing;E - Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities;;A2 - Forestry and logging;E39 - Remediation activities and other waste management services;;A2.1 - Silviculture and other forestry activities;E39.0 - Remediation activities and other waste management services;;The target involves balancing emissions and removals in land use, focusing on forestry and waste management.;9
TA1.14;Each Member State shall ensure that the annual sum of its greenhouse gas emissions and removals on its territory and in all of the land reporting categories, in each year in the period from 2026 to 2030, does not exceed the limit established by a linear trajectory, ending in 2030 on the target set out for that Member State (no debit rule);A - Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing;E - Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities;;A2 - Forestry and logging;E39 - Remediation activities and other waste management services;;A2.1 - Silviculture and other forestry activities;E39.0 - Remediation activities and other waste management services;;The target is focused on maintaining a balance of emissions and removals in land use, particularly in forestry.;9
