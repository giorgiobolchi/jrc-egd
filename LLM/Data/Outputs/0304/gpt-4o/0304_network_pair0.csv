TA1.1;Climate Neutrality (2040 target under discussion);TA2.1;+;Achieving climate neutrality will likely increase the demand for renewable hydrogen as a clean energy source, supporting the target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production.
TA1.1;Climate Neutrality (2040 target under discussion);TA2.9;+;The push for climate neutrality will drive the need for increased renewable energy, positively impacting the target of achieving at least 42.5% renewable energy in the EU's gross final consumption by 2030.
TA1.10;The total quantity of allowances for the new emissions trading system should follow a linear trajectory to reach the emission reduction target for 2030, taking into account the cost-efficient contribution of the buildings and road transport sectors of 43 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a combined cost-efficient contribution of 42 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005.;TA2.13;+;The reduction in emissions from buildings and transport will likely increase the demand for renewable fuels and electricity, supporting the target of at least 29% renewable energy in the transport sector by 2030.
TA1.11;Upgrade national targets in line with an EU-wide reduction of 40% in the ESR sectors compared to 2005. Member States contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030 with targets ranging from -10% to -50% below 2005 level (sectors: transport, buildings, agriculture and waste);TA2.16;+;The reduction in emissions in ESR sectors will necessitate increased use of renewable energy, supporting the target of increasing the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling.
TA1.12;Achieve an EU net greenhouse gas removal of 310 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector;TA2.19;+;Enhancing carbon sinks through LULUCF can support the transition to renewable and low-carbon energy sources in the fisheries sector by offsetting emissions.
TA1.13;For the period from 2021 to 2025 each Member State shall ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from the sector do not exceed greenhouse gas removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals on its territory in all of the land accounting categories (no debit rule). The accounting benchmark for the EU is ca. -229 Mt CO2e/yr for 2021-2025.;TA2.12;+;The focus on balancing emissions and removals will encourage the use of renewable energy in industry, supporting the target of increasing the share of renewable sources in energy used for final energy and non-energy purposes.
TA1.14;Each Member State shall ensure that the annual sum of its greenhouse gas emissions and removals on its territory and in all of the land reporting categories, in each year in the period from 2026 to 2030, does not exceed the limit established by a linear trajectory, ending in 2030 on the target set out for that Member State(no debit rule);TA2.22;+;The requirement for emissions and removals balance will drive efforts to reduce energy consumption, supporting the target of reducing energy consumption by at least 11.7% by 2030.
TA1.15;Reduce buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, compared to 2015 levels, by 2030;TA2.25;+;Reducing emissions in buildings will likely lead to increased energy efficiency, supporting the target of reducing buildings' final energy consumption by 14%.
TA1.16;To achieve 55% reduction of GHG emission by 2030, methane emissions related to energy production and consumption should be reduced by 58% compared to the level in 2020;TA2.37;+;Reducing methane emissions will support the transition to renewable energy, contributing to the target of doubling the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix by 2030.
TA2.1;Renewable hydrogen will be key to replace natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport. REPowerEU sets a target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production and 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen imports by 2030;TA1.1;+;The production and import of renewable hydrogen will support the EU's climate neutrality goals by providing a clean energy source for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.
TA2.9;Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union’s gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 42.5 %.;TA1.1;+;Increasing the share of renewable energy will directly contribute to achieving climate neutrality by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
TA2.13;Each Member State shall set an obligation on fuel suppliers to ensure that: (a) the amount of renewable fuels and renewable electricity supplied to the transport sector leads to a: (i) share of renewable energy within the final consumption of energy in the transport sector of at least 29 % by 2030, or i) greenhouse gas intensity reduction of at least 14,5 % by 2030, compared to the baseline set out in Article 27(1), point (b), in accordance with an indicative trajectory set by the Member State,;TA1.10;+;The obligation on fuel suppliers to increase renewable energy in transport will support the emission reduction targets in the buildings and transport sectors.
TA2.16;Each Member State shall increase the share of renewable energy in that sector by at least 0,8 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the period 2021 to 2025 and by at least 1,1 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the period 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector in 2020;TA1.11;+;Increasing the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling will contribute to the reduction targets in the ESR sectors.
TA2.19;The fisheries sector must follow the two mutually reinforcing paths of reducing energy intensity, on the one hand, and switching to renewable and low-carbon energy sources, on the other hand;TA1.12;+;The transition to renewable energy in fisheries will be supported by enhanced carbon sinks, contributing to overall GHG reduction.
TA2.22;Member States shall collectively ensure a reduction of energy consumption of at least 11,7 % in 2030 compared to the projections of the 2020 EU Reference Scenario so that the Union’s final energy consumption amounts to no more than 763 Mtoe (art. 4 Directive);TA1.14;+;Reducing energy consumption will aid in achieving the balance of emissions and removals required by the no debit rule.
TA2.25;Reduce buildings' final energy consumption by 14%;TA1.15;+;Reducing energy consumption in buildings will directly support the target of reducing GHG emissions by 60% in the building sector.
TA2.37;By 2030, the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix should double to 55-60%, and projections show a share of around 84% by 2050. The remaining gap should be covered by other low-carbon options;TA1.16;+;Increasing the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix will help reduce methane emissions related to energy production and consumption.
