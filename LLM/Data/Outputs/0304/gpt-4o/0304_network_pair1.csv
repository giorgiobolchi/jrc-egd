TA1.1;Climate Neutrality (2040 target under discussion);TA3.3;+;Achieving climate neutrality will likely promote circular economy practices, as reducing emissions often involves more efficient resource use and waste reduction.
TA1.10;The total quantity of allowances for the new emissions trading system should follow a linear trajectory to reach the emission reduction target for 2030, taking into account the cost-efficient contribution of the buildings and road transport sectors of 43 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a combined cost-efficient contribution of 42 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005.;TA3.2;+;Reducing emissions in buildings and transport can lead to less waste generation and more efficient use of resources, supporting the reduction of landfill waste.
TA1.11;Upgrade national targets in line with an EU-wide reduction of 40% in the ESR sectors compared to 2005. Member States contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030 with targets ranging from -10% to -50% below 2005 level (sectors: transport, buildings, agriculture and waste);TA3.1;+;Reducing emissions in sectors like waste aligns with the goal of halving residual municipal waste, as both aim to minimize environmental impact.
TA1.12;Achieve an EU net greenhouse gas removal of 310 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector;TA3.24;+;Enhancing carbon sinks through land use and forestry can support the reduction of food waste by promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
TA1.13;For the period from 2021 to 2025 each Member State shall ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from the sector do not exceed greenhouse gas removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals on its territory in all of the land accounting categories (no debit rule). The accounting benchmark for the EU is ca. -229 Mt CO2e/yr for 2021-2025.;TA3.25;+;Balancing emissions and removals can encourage practices that reduce food waste, as sustainable land management often involves efficient resource use.
TA1.14;Each Member State shall ensure that the annual sum of its greenhouse gas emissions and removals on its territory and in all of the land reporting categories, in each year in the period from 2026 to 2030, does not exceed the limit established by a linear trajectory, ending in 2030 on the target set out for that Member State(no debit rule);TA3.4;+;Maintaining a balance between emissions and removals can promote sustainable practices in textile production, aligning with the goal of recyclable and long-lived textile products.
TA1.15;Reduce buildingsâ€™ greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, compared to 2015 levels, by 2030;TA3.2;+;Reducing emissions in buildings can lead to more efficient resource use and waste reduction, supporting the goal of reducing landfill waste.
TA1.16;To achieve 55% reduction of GHG emission by 2030, methane emissions related to energy production and consumption should be reduced by 58% compared to the level in 2020;TA3.7;+;Reducing methane emissions can support the reduction of methane emissions from waste, aligning with the goal of reducing methane emissions by 35% compared to 2005 levels.
TA3.1;Halve the amount of residual (non-recycled) municipal waste;TA1.11;+;Reducing waste aligns with emission reduction targets in the waste sector, supporting overall GHG reduction goals.
TA3.2;Reduce landfill to a maximum of 10% of municipal waste;TA1.15;+;Efficient resource use in buildings can reduce waste generation, supporting the goal of reducing landfill waste.
TA3.3;Double its circular material use rate in the coming decade;TA1.1;+;Circular economy practices can contribute to climate neutrality by reducing emissions through efficient resource use.
TA3.4;By 2030 textile products placed on the EU market are long-lived and recyclable, to a great extent made of recycled fibres, free of hazardous substances and produced in respect of social rights and the environment;TA1.14;+;Sustainable textile production can contribute to maintaining a balance between emissions and removals, supporting climate goals.
TA3.7;Reduce methane emissions of 35% if compared to 2005 levels;TA1.16;+;Reducing methane emissions in waste aligns with the goal of reducing methane emissions from energy production and consumption.
TA3.24;Reduce the generation of food waste in processing and manufacturing by 10% in comparison to the amount generated in 2020;TA1.12;+;Sustainable agricultural practices that enhance carbon sinks can support the reduction of food waste.
TA3.25;Reduce the generation of food waste per capita, jointly in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services and in households, by 30 % in comparison to the amount generated in 2020;TA1.13;+;Efficient resource use in land management can support the reduction of food waste, aligning with emission balance goals.
