TA4.49;The death toll for all modes of transport in the EU will be close to zero;TA2.40;+;The increased safety of transportation will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, thus supporting the target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix.
TA4.50;Active transport modes, such as cycling, have seen growth with cities announcing over 2300 km of extra cycling infrastructure;TA2.40;+;The increased use of active transport modes will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, thus supporting the target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix.
TA4.51;Zero-emission in urban logistics;TA2.16;+;The increased use of zero-emission urban logistics will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, thus supporting the target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix.
TA4.52;Increase the uptake of short-sea shipping instead of using more polluting modes;TA2.39;+;The increased use of short-sea shipping will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, thus supporting the target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix.
TA4.53;Renovate the EU’s maritime fleet;TA2.5;+;The renovation of the EU's maritime fleet will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime transport sector, thus supporting the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.
TA4.54;Pursue the objective of zero-emission ports;TA2.1;+;The increased use of zero-emission ports will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime transport sector, thus supporting the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.
TA4.55;Cut the emissions of transport sector by 90% by 2050;TA2.1;-;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector may lead to an increase in the cost of transportation, which could negatively impact the EU's climate ambition by increasing the cost of food production and potentially leading to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors.
