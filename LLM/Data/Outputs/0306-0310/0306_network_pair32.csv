TA3.38;The Union's access to a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials by ensuring that the Union's extraction capacity is able to extract the ores, minerals or concentrates needed to produce at least 10% of the Union's annual consumption of strategic raw materials, to the extent that the Union’s reserves allow for this;TA5.3;+;The increased extraction of critical raw materials could lead to a reduction in nutrient losses, as the mining activities might be designed to minimize environmental impacts, thus contributing to the target of reducing nutrient losses by at least 50%.
TA3.38;The Union's access to a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials by ensuring that the Union's extraction capacity is able to extract the ores, minerals or concentrates needed to produce at least 10% of the Union's annual consumption of strategic raw materials, to the extent that the Union’s reserves allow for this;TA5.9;+;The extraction of critical raw materials, such as those needed for renewable energy technologies, could support the target of increasing organic farming, as these materials might be used in more sustainable agricultural practices.
TA3.38;The Union's access to a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials by ensuring that the Union's extraction capacity is able to extract the ores, minerals or concentrates needed to produce at least 10% of the Union's annual consumption of strategic raw materials, to the extent that the Union’s reserves allow for this;TA4.1;+;The secure supply of critical raw materials could support the production of sustainable biomethane, as these materials might be used in the production of biomethane, thus contributing to the target of producing 35 billion cubic meters of sustainable biomethane by 2030.
TA5.3;Reduce nutrient losses by at least 50%, while ensuring no deterioration on soil fertility;TA3.38;-;The extraction of critical raw materials might lead to soil degradation and nutrient losses, thus hindering the target of reducing nutrient losses by at least 50%.
TA5.9;Increase organic farming with the aim to achieve at least 25% of total farmland under organic farming by 2030;TA3.38;+;The increased use of organic farming practices could lead to a reduced demand for critical raw materials used in conventional farming, thus supporting the target of ensuring a secure and sustainable supply of these materials.
TA4.1;The amendments in Dir. 2023/2413 are also intended to support the achievement of the Union’s target of an annual production of sustainable biomethane of 35 billion cubic meters by 2030;TA3.38;+;The production of sustainable biomethane could be supported by the secure supply of critical raw materials, such as those needed for the production of biomethane, thus contributing to the target of producing 35 billion cubic meters of sustainable biomethane by 2030.
TA4.12;GHG intensity reduction target in the maritime sector;TA3.38;-;The increased extraction of critical raw materials might lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, thus hindering the target of reducing GHG intensity in the maritime sector.
TA5.2;Reduce overall EU sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture by 50% by 2030;TA3.38;-;The use of critical raw materials in animal farming might lead to an increased use of antimicrobials, thus hindering the target of reducing antimicrobial sales by 50% by 2030.
TA5.4;Reduce by 50% the use of more hazardous pesticides;TA3.38;-;The extraction of critical raw materials might lead to an increased use of hazardous pesticides, thus hindering the target of reducing the use of these pesticides by 50%.
TA6.1;Legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU's land area;TA3.38;-;The extraction of critical raw materials might lead to habitat destruction and biodiversity loss, thus hindering the target of protecting 30% of the EU's land area.
