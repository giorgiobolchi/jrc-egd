TA6.12;The losses of nutrients from fertilisers are reduced by 50%, resulting in the reduction of the use of fertilisers by at least 20%;TA3.14;;+;The reduction of nutrient losses from fertilisers in TA6.12 is likely to have a positive impact on reducing waste generation in TA3.14, as it promotes more efficient use of fertilisers and reduces the amount of nutrients released into the environment.
TA6.12;The losses of nutrients from fertilisers are reduced by 50%, resulting in the reduction of the use of fertilisers by at least 20%;TA3.20;+;The reduction of nutrient losses from fertilisers in TA6.12 is likely to have a positive impact on improving recycling efficiency in TA3.20, as it reduces the amount of nutrients released into the environment and promotes more efficient use of resources.
TA3.14;;TA6.12;-;The generation of waste in TA3.14 is likely to have a negative impact on the reduction of nutrient losses from fertilisers in TA6.12, as increased waste generation can lead to increased nutrient pollution and reduced efficiency in fertiliser use.
TA3.20;Recycling shall achieve at least the following targets for recycling efficiency: No later than 31 December 2025 - 75% by average weight of lead-acid batteries;TA6.12;+;The improvement of recycling efficiency in TA3.20 is likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of nutrient losses from fertilisers in TA6.12, as it promotes the recovery and reuse of resources and reduces waste generation.
TA6.17;The negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, including on the seabed through fishing and extraction activities, are substantially reduced to achieve good environmental status;TA3.25;-;The reduction of negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats in TA6.17 is likely to have a negative impact on the reduction of food waste in TA3.25, as it may lead to increased fishing restrictions and reduced food availability.
TA3.25;Reduce the generation of food waste in processing and manufacturing by 10% in comparison to the amount generated in 2020;TA6.17;+;The reduction of food waste in TA3.25 is likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats in TA6.17, as it reduces the demand for fishing and extraction activities and promotes more sustainable food systems.
TA6.14;There is a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species;TA3.14;-;The reduction of invasive alien species in TA6.14 is likely to have a negative impact on the generation of waste in TA3.14, as it may lead to increased efforts to control and eradicate invasive species, resulting in increased waste generation.
TA3.14;;TA6.14;+;The reduction of waste generation in TA3.14 is likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of invasive alien species in TA6.14, as it reduces the introduction and spread of invasive species through waste and promotes more sustainable practices.
