TA6.12;The by-catch of species is eliminated or reduced to a level that allows species recovery and conservation;TA1.9;+;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, as targeted by TA1.9, is likely to have a positive impact on the conservation of species, as reduced emissions can lead to healthier ecosystems and reduced pollution, which in turn can help reduce by-catch and promote species recovery.
TA1.9;The contribution of the sectors covered by the EU ETS with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62 % compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2 % per year up to 4.4 %);TA6.12;-;The implementation of TA1.9, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, may have a negative impact on the by-catch of species, as the increased focus on renewable energy sources and reduced emissions could lead to the displacement of fishing activities and increased by-catch in other areas.
TA2.2;Set up at least one renewables-based energy community in every municipality with a population higher than 10.000;TA6.17;+;The establishment of renewables-based energy communities, as targeted by TA2.2, is likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, as renewable energy sources can reduce pollution and promote healthier ecosystems.
TA6.17;The negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, including on the seabed through fishing and extraction activities, are substantially reduced to achieve good environmental status;TA2.2;-;The implementation of TA6.17, which aims to reduce negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, may have a negative impact on the establishment of renewables-based energy communities, as the increased focus on environmental protection could lead to restrictions on the development of renewable energy sources in sensitive areas.
TA3.3;Strictly protect at least a third of the EU'S protected areas;TA6.12;+;The protection of at least a third of the EU's protected areas, as targeted by TA3.3, is likely to have a positive impact on the conservation of species, as protected areas can provide a safe habitat for species to recover and thrive.
TA6.12;The by-catch of species is eliminated or reduced to a level that allows species recovery and conservation;TA3.3;-;The implementation of TA3.3, which aims to protect at least a third of the EU's protected areas, may have a negative impact on the by-catch of species, as the increased protection of areas could lead to the displacement of fishing activities and increased by-catch in other areas.
TA4.1;Increase the share of renewable energy in the transport sector;TA6.17;+;The increase in the share of renewable energy in the transport sector, as targeted by TA4.1, is likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, as renewable energy sources can reduce pollution and promote healthier ecosystems.
TA6.17;The negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, including on the seabed through fishing and extraction activities, are substantially reduced to achieve good environmental status;TA4.1;-;The implementation of TA4.1, which aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the transport sector, may have a negative impact on the reduction of negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, as the increased focus on renewable energy sources could lead to the displacement of activities and increased negative impacts in other areas.
TA5.1;Reduce the use of chemical pesticides by 50%;TA6.12;+;The reduction of chemical pesticides, as targeted by TA5.1, is likely to have a positive impact on the conservation of species, as reduced pesticide use can lead to healthier ecosystems and reduced pollution, which in turn can help reduce by-catch and promote species recovery.
TA6.12;The by-catch of species is eliminated or reduced to a level that allows species recovery and conservation;TA5.1;-;The implementation of TA5.1, which aims to reduce chemical pesticide use, may have a negative impact on the by-catch of species, as the reduced use of pesticides could lead to increased use of other methods that may harm species.
TA6.14;There is a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species;TA2.2;+;The reduction of invasive alien species, as targeted by TA6.14, is likely to have a positive impact on the establishment of renewables-based energy communities, as reduced invasive species can lead to healthier ecosystems and increased biodiversity, which can in turn support the development of renewable energy sources.
TA2.2;Set up at least one renewables-based energy community in every municipality with a population higher than 10.000;TA6.14;-;The implementation of TA2.2, which aims to establish renewables-based energy communities, may have a negative impact on the reduction of invasive alien species, as the increased development of renewable energy sources could lead to the displacement of species and increased invasive species in other areas.
