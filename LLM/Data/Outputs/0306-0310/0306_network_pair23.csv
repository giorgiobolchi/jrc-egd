TA3.11;The EU's ambition to achieve at least 25% of total farmland under organic farming by 2030;TA5.2;+;The increase in organic farming can lead to a reduction in the use of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture, as organic farming practices often involve more natural and sustainable methods of disease prevention and treatment.
TA3.11;The EU's ambition to achieve at least 25% of total farmland under organic farming by 2030;TA5.4;+;The adoption of organic farming practices can contribute to a reduction in the use of more hazardous pesticides, as organic farming emphasizes the use of natural and integrated pest management methods.
TA3.11;The EU's ambition to achieve at least 25% of total farmland under organic farming by 2030;TA5.5;+;The shift towards organic farming can help reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides, as organic farming promotes more sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices.
TA5.2;Reduce overall EU sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture by 50% by 2030;TA3.11;-;The reduction in antimicrobial sales may lead to increased costs for farmers, potentially making organic farming practices less competitive, and thus negatively impacting the achievement of the 25% organic farming target.
TA5.4;Reduce by 50% the use of more hazardous pesticides;TA3.11;+;The reduction in hazardous pesticide use can contribute to a healthier environment and ecosystem, making it more feasible to achieve the 25% organic farming target, as organic farming practices are often more compatible with sustainable and environmentally friendly methods.
TA5.5;Reduce by 50% the use and risk of chemical pesticides;TA3.11;+;The decrease in chemical pesticide use can lead to improved environmental and health outcomes, creating a more favorable context for the adoption of organic farming practices, and thus supporting the achievement of the 25% organic farming target.
