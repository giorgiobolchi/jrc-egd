TA6.12;The losses of nutrients from fertilisers are reduced by 50%, resulting in the reduction of the use of fertilisers by at least 20%;TA3.4;+;The reduction of nutrient losses from fertilisers is likely to have a positive impact on the target of having at least 65% of municipal waste recycled by 2025 and 70% by 2030, as it reduces the amount of waste generated from fertiliser production and use.
TA6.12;The losses of nutrients from fertilisers are reduced by 50%, resulting in the reduction of the use of fertilisers by at least 20%;TA3.42;-;However, the reduction of fertiliser use might have a negative impact on the recycling targets for waste electronic and electrical equipment, as fertilisers are not directly related to WEEE.
TA3.4;By 2030 textile products placed on the EU market are long-lived and recyclable, to a great extent made of recycled fibres, free of hazardous substances and produced in respect of social rights and the environment;TA6.14;+;The production of long-lived and recyclable textile products is likely to have a positive impact on the target of reducing the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species, as it promotes sustainable production and consumption practices.
TA3.4;By 2030 textile products placed on the EU market are long-lived and recyclable, to a great extent made of recycled fibres, free of hazardous substances and produced in respect of social rights and the environment;TA6.17;-;However, the increased demand for recycled fibres might have a negative impact on the target of substantially reducing the negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, as it could lead to over-exploitation of certain resources.
TA6.14;There is a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species;TA3.40;+;The reduction of invasive alien species is likely to have a positive impact on the target of having at least 77% of waste single-use plastic beverage bottles collected for recycling by 2025 and 90% by 2029, as it reduces the amount of waste generated from invasive species.
TA6.14;There is a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species;TA3.46;-;However, the reduction of invasive alien species might have a negative impact on the target of reducing food waste, as it could lead to a decrease in the availability of certain food sources.
TA3.40;Member States shall meet the target of 77% by weight for the separate collection for recycling of waste single-use plastic beverage bottles by 2025 and 90% by 2029;TA6.12;+;The increased recycling of plastic beverage bottles is likely to have a positive impact on the target of reducing nutrient losses from fertilisers, as it reduces the amount of waste generated from fertiliser production and use.
