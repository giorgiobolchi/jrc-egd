TA6.38;Protecting EU’s last remaining primary and old-growth forests;TA5.2;+;The protection of primary and old-growth forests can help reduce the overall EU sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture by preserving biodiversity and promoting sustainable land use practices, which in turn can lead to reduced use of antimicrobials.
TA6.38;Protecting EU’s last remaining primary and old-growth forests;TA5.24;+;Protecting primary and old-growth forests can contribute to ensuring fair, inclusive, and ethical value chains by promoting sustainable forestry practices and reducing the risk of deforestation and habitat destruction, which can have positive impacts on workers' social protection and housing conditions.
TA6.38;Protecting EU’s last remaining primary and old-growth forests;TA5.29;+;The protection of primary and old-growth forests can help improve the availability of sustainable food by preserving biodiversity, promoting ecosystem services, and maintaining ecosystem health, which can lead to increased food security and availability of sustainable food options.
TA5.2;Reduce overall EU sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture by 50% by 2030;TA6.38;+;Reducing antimicrobial sales can help protect primary and old-growth forests by promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reducing the use of antimicrobials, and preserving biodiversity, which can lead to improved forest health and reduced deforestation.
TA5.2;Reduce overall EU sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture by 50% by 2030;TA6.42;+;Reducing antimicrobial sales can contribute to the restoration of natural connectivity of rivers and natural functions of related floodplains by promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reducing pollution, and preserving biodiversity, which can lead to improved river health and ecosystem services.
TA5.24;Ensure Fair, inclusive and ethical value chains;TA6.38;-;The implementation of fair, inclusive, and ethical value chains may lead to increased demand for wood and forest products, potentially threatening the protection of primary and old-growth forests if not managed sustainably.
TA5.29;Improve availability of sustainable food;TA6.38;+;Improving the availability of sustainable food can help protect primary and old-growth forests by promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reducing deforestation, and preserving biodiversity, which can lead to improved ecosystem services and forest health.
TA6.42;Restore the natural connectivity of rivers and natural functions of the related floodplains;TA5.2;+;Restoring river connectivity and natural functions can help reduce antimicrobial sales by promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reducing pollution, and preserving biodiversity, which can lead to improved water quality and ecosystem health.
TA6.42;Restore the natural connectivity of rivers and natural functions of the related floodplains;TA5.24;+;Restoring river connectivity and natural functions can contribute to ensuring fair, inclusive, and ethical value chains by promoting sustainable water management practices, reducing the risk of water pollution, and preserving biodiversity, which can have positive impacts on workers' social protection and housing conditions.
