TA6.38;Protecting EU’s last remaining primary and old-growth forests;TA1.9;+;The protection of primary and old-growth forests can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which is a key objective of the EU Climate ambition, as forests act as carbon sinks.
TA6.38;Protecting EU’s last remaining primary and old-growth forests;TA6.4;+;Protecting primary and old-growth forests is also crucial for preserving biodiversity, as these forests provide habitat for a wide range of species, and their preservation can help to achieve the objectives of the Nature Restoration Law.
TA1.9;The contribution of the sectors covered by the EU ETS with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62 % compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2 % per year up to 4.4 %);TA6.38;+;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the EU ETS sectors can have a positive impact on the protection of primary and old-growth forests, as it can lead to a decrease in the demand for wood and other forest products.
TA1.10;The total quantity of allowances for the new emissions trading system should follow a linear trajectory to reach the emission reduction target for 2030, taking into account the cost-efficient contribution of the buildings and road transport sectors of 43 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005;TA6.51;+;The reduction of emissions from the buildings and road transport sectors can have a positive impact on the preservation of biodiversity in forest ecosystems, as it can lead to a decrease in the demand for energy and transportation infrastructure that can harm forests.
TA6.51;Member States shall achieve an increasing trend at national level of at least six out of seven of the following indicators in forest ecosystems, as further set out in Annex VI;TA1.12;+;The preservation of biodiversity in forest ecosystems can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as forests act as carbon sinks and can help to achieve the objectives of the LULUCF sector.
TA2.2;Set up at least one renewables-based energy community in every municipality with a population higher than 10.000;TA6.38;-;The development of renewables-based energy communities can lead to an increase in energy demand, which can result in an increased demand for land, potentially leading to deforestation and habitat destruction, negatively impacting the protection of primary and old-growth forests.
TA6.4;2b. Strictly protect all remaining EU primary and old-growth forests;TA2.13;+;The protection of primary and old-growth forests can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, as it can lead to a decrease in the demand for biofuels and other forest products that can contribute to emissions.
TA2.13;Each Member State shall set an obligation on fuel suppliers to ensure that: (a) the amount of renewable fuels and renewable electricity supplied to the transport sector leads to a: (i) share of renewable energy within the final consumption of energy in the transport sector of at least 29 % by 2030;TA6.51;+;The increase in the share of renewable energy in the transport sector can have a positive impact on the preservation of biodiversity in forest ecosystems, as it can lead to a decrease in the demand for fossil fuels and other energy sources that can harm forests.
TA6.51;Member States shall achieve an increasing trend at national level of at least six out of seven of the following indicators in forest ecosystems, as further set out in Annex VI;TA2.14;+;The preservation of biodiversity in forest ecosystems can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the industry sector, as forests act as carbon sinks and can help to achieve the objectives of the EU's climate ambition.
TA2.14;Member States shall endeavour to increase the share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold in district heating and cooling by an indicative 2,2 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the period 2021 to 2030;TA6.38;+;The increase in the share of renewable energy in district heating and cooling can have a positive impact on the protection of primary and old-growth forests, as it can lead to a decrease in the demand for fossil fuels and other energy sources that can harm forests.
