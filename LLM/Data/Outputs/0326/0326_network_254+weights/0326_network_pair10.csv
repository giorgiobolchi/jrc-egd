Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.38,TA2.39;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;Reinforcing;The increased use of renewable energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn can help to restore terrestrial ecosystems by mitigating climate change impacts.
Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.38,TA2.39;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;Reinforcing;The shift towards renewable energy can reduce pollution and habitat destruction caused by fossil fuel extraction and use, thereby protecting biodiversity.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.40;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-1;Constraining;The production of renewable hydrogen may require large areas of land for energy crops, potentially competing with agricultural land use and constraining ecosystem restoration efforts in agricultural ecosystems.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+1;Enabling;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can reduce energy consumption, which in turn can decrease the urban heat island effect and create more livable urban spaces, enabling the protection and restoration of urban nature.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.18,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;-2;Counteracting;The renovation and insulation of buildings can lead to increased demand for wood products, potentially counteracting efforts to restore and preserve forests.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+1;Enabling;Ensuring access to renewable energy and reducing energy poverty can enable the protection of marine ecosystems and fisheries by reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change impacts.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+1;Enabling;The deployment of solar panels can help to restore rivers by reducing water pollution from fossil fuel extraction and use, and by providing a clean source of energy for water treatment and management.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+3;Indivisible;The development of offshore renewable energy can directly contribute to the restoration of marine ecosystems by providing a clean source of energy, reducing pollution, and creating artificial reefs that can support marine life.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.18,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;+1;Enabling;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can reduce energy consumption, which in turn can decrease the urban heat island effect and create more livable urban spaces, enabling the monitoring and protection of urban biodiversity.
