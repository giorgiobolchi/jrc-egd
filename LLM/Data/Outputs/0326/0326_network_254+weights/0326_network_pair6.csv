Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;GHG Reduction;+;2;The increased use of renewable energy sources can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, thereby reinforcing the achievement of GHG reduction targets. This is because renewable energy sources like solar and wind power do not emit greenhouse gases during operation.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40;GHG Reduction;+;2;Hydrogen production from renewable energy sources can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, including transportation and industry, thus reinforcing GHG reduction efforts.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;GHG Reduction;+;2;Improving energy efficiency can lead to a decrease in energy consumption, which in turn can result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, thereby supporting the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;3;Energy efficiency measures in buildings, such as insulation and efficient heating systems, can directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, making it indivisible from achieving GHG reduction targets in the buildings sector.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Climate Resilience;+;1;Social security measures related to energy, such as protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty, can create conditions that further climate resilience by ensuring that all members of society have access to the energy resources they need to adapt to climate change.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7;GHG Reduction;+;2;The expansion of solar energy can significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, thereby reinforcing efforts to achieve GHG reduction targets.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;GHG Reduction;+;2;Offshore renewable energy can play a crucial role in decarbonizing the energy sector, supporting the achievement of GHG reduction targets by providing a clean source of energy.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.4;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;3;Renewable energy solutions for heating and cooling, such as heat pumps, can directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, making it indivisible from achieving GHG reduction targets in the buildings sector.
