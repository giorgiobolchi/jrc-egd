Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.13,TA2.14,TA2.15,TA2.16,TA2.17,TA2.18,TA2.19,TA2.2,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36,TA2.37,TA2.38,TA2.39,TA2.4,TA2.40,TA2.41,TA2.42,TA2.43,TA2.44,TA2.45,TA2.46,TA2.47,TA2.48,TA2.49,TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.8,TA2.9;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in waste generation from municipal solid waste, as renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power produce little to no waste. This can aid in the achievement of waste reduction targets in municipal waste.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.40,TA2.41,TA2.42,TA2.43,TA2.44;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;2;The production of renewable hydrogen may require the extraction of critical raw materials, potentially leading to conflicts with the goals of reducing extraction and promoting sustainable import practices. This could limit options for achieving targets related to critical raw materials.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Circularity/Recycling;+;1;Improving energy efficiency can create conditions that further the goals of circularity and recycling, as reduced energy consumption can lead to decreased waste generation and increased recycling rates.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;1;Energy-efficient buildings can reduce waste generation from municipal solid waste by decreasing energy consumption and promoting recycling practices.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;-;1;The focus on social security and energy may lead to increased food waste if energy-intensive food production and distribution practices are not addressed, potentially constraining progress in reducing food waste.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;2;The production of solar panels requires the extraction of critical raw materials, which can lead to conflicts with the goals of reducing extraction and promoting sustainable import practices, limiting options for achieving targets related to critical raw materials.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;2;The development of offshore renewable energy technologies can aid in the achievement of net-zero technology manufacturing targets by providing a source of clean energy for manufacturing processes.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.4;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;1;The increased use of renewable energy for heating and cooling can lead to a reduction in waste generation from municipal solid waste, as renewable energy sources produce little to no waste, creating conditions that further the goals of circularity and recycling.
