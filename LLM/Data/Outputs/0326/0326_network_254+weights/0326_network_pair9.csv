Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;Food quality;+2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn can improve air quality and have a positive impact on food quality. This is because air pollution from fossil fuels can damage crops and reduce food yields.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21;Food affordability;+1;The production of renewable hydrogen can lead to the development of new technologies and industries, creating jobs and stimulating local economies, which can have a positive impact on food affordability. This is because local economic growth can lead to increased access to affordable and nutritious food.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Competitive Agriculture;-1;Improving energy efficiency can lead to reduced energy consumption, which can constrain agricultural production and competitiveness. This is because energy-intensive farming practices may need to be adapted or reduced to meet energy efficiency targets.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Food quality - Healthy Food;+2;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can lead to reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which can have a positive impact on indoor air quality and food storage, ultimately contributing to healthier food. This is because energy-efficient buildings can provide a healthier environment for food preparation and storage.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Food affordability;+1;Ensuring access to affordable energy can have a positive impact on food affordability, as energy is often a significant cost factor in food production and processing. This is because affordable energy can reduce the cost of food production and make it more accessible to low-income households.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7;Pesticides Reduction;+2;The increased use of solar energy can lead to reduced dependence on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions, which can have a positive impact on soil and water quality, reducing the need for pesticides. This is because solar energy can power sustainable agriculture practices that promote soil health and biodiversity.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;Competitive Agriculture;-1;The development of offshore renewable energy can lead to conflicts with fishing and aquaculture industries, potentially constraining agricultural production and competitiveness. This is because offshore wind farms and other renewable energy infrastructure can occupy space that was previously used for fishing and aquaculture.
