GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can reinforce waste reduction efforts by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the environmental impact of waste management.;The connection between GHG reduction and waste reduction is evident in the EU's circular economy strategy, which aims to reduce waste and promote sustainable consumption.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling;+2;GHG reduction targets can aid the development of circular economy practices, such as recycling and reuse, by creating a market demand for sustainable products and services.;This connection is supported by the EU's Circular Economy Action Plan, which highlights the importance of reducing GHG emissions in the production and consumption of goods.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;The reduction of GHG emissions in buildings can enable waste reduction efforts by promoting the use of sustainable materials and reducing energy consumption.;This connection is evident in the EU's Renovation Wave strategy, which aims to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions in buildings while promoting sustainable materials and waste reduction.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.14;Circularity/Recycling - Vehicle Circularity;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions in transportation can reinforce the development of circular economy practices in the automotive sector, such as vehicle sharing and recycling.;This connection is supported by the EU's Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, which highlights the importance of reducing GHG emissions and promoting sustainable transportation modes.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+1;The development of GHG removal technologies can enable the sustainable extraction and use of critical raw materials, reducing the environmental impact of their production.;This connection is evident in the EU's Critical Raw Materials Strategy, which highlights the importance of sustainable extraction and use of critical raw materials.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+2;Climate resilience measures can aid the reduction of food waste by promoting sustainable agricultural practices and reducing the environmental impact of food production.;This connection is supported by the EU's Farm to Fork strategy, which aims to reduce food waste and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;-1;The development of net-zero technologies can constrain GHG reduction efforts by creating new energy demands and potentially increasing GHG emissions in the short term.;This connection is evident in the EU's Net-Zero Industry Act, which highlights the importance of reducing GHG emissions in industrial processes while promoting the development of net-zero technologies.
