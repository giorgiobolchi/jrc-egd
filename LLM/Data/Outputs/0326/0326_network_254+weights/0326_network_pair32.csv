Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;The protection of biodiversity can enable waste reduction by preserving ecosystems that help to maintain soil quality, air quality, and water quality, which in turn can reduce the amount of waste generated.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Circularity/Recycling;+2;Biodiversity protection can reinforce circularity and recycling by preserving natural resources, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable consumption patterns.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-2;The restoration of forests can counteract the extraction and import of critical raw materials by reducing the demand for these materials and promoting sustainable forest management practices.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+3;The restoration of marine ecosystems is indivisible from the development of net-zero technology manufacturing, as it can provide a source of renewable energy and promote sustainable economic growth.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+1;The protection of urban nature can enable circularity and recycling in municipal waste management by promoting green infrastructure, reducing waste generation, and increasing recycling rates.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+2;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can reinforce waste reduction in food waste by promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reducing food loss, and increasing food recovery.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;-1;The protection of fisheries can constrain the circularity and recycling of plastic and packaging by limiting the availability of marine resources and promoting sustainable fishing practices.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.11,TA5.13,TA5.15,TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;Waste Reduction;-3;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can cancel out waste reduction efforts if not managed sustainably, as it may lead to increased waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+1;The monitoring of biodiversity can enable the circularity and recycling of critical raw materials in batteries by promoting sustainable consumption patterns and reducing waste generation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+2;The restoration of rivers can reinforce waste reduction and circularity in plastic and packaging by promoting sustainable water management practices, reducing plastic pollution, and increasing recycling rates.
