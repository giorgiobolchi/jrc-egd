GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;Reinforcing;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate climate change, which in turn can reinforce biodiversity protection and conservation efforts by reducing the pressure of climate-related stressors on ecosystems.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;Reinforcing;GHG reduction targets can reinforce terrestrial ecosystems restoration by promoting sustainable land use practices, reducing deforestation, and encouraging reforestation, which helps to sequester carbon dioxide.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+1;Enabling;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can enable the restoration of forests by reducing the demand for wood and other forest products, thereby creating conditions for forest regeneration.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+1;Enabling;GHG removal technologies can enable marine ecosystem restoration by reducing ocean acidification, which is caused by the absorption of excess CO2, and promoting the health of marine ecosystems.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+2;Reinforcing;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on fisheries and marine ecosystems, reinforcing biodiversity protection and conservation efforts in these areas.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.14,TA1.16;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+1;Enabling;Promoting sustainable transportation options can enable the restoration of agricultural ecosystems by reducing the environmental impacts of transportation, such as air pollution and habitat fragmentation, and encouraging more sustainable agricultural practices.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+2;Reinforcing;Enhancing climate resilience can reinforce biodiversity protection and conservation efforts in urban areas by promoting green infrastructure, reducing the urban heat island effect, and creating habitats for urban wildlife.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+1;Enabling;Reducing GHG emissions can enable the restoration of rivers by promoting sustainable water management practices, reducing pollution, and encouraging the conservation of riverine ecosystems.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;+1;Enabling;GHG removal technologies can enable biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts by providing a means to track and mitigate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, promoting more effective conservation strategies.
