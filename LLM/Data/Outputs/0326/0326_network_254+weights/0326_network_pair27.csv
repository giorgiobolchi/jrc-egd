Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Transport Logistics;-1;The implementation of competitive agriculture targets may lead to increased transportation needs, potentially constraining the options for reducing emissions in the transport sector.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+1;Reducing pesticide use can enable the development of more sustainable agricultural practices, which can in turn support the production of biofuels for road vehicles, creating conditions that further the achievement of net-zero technology targets.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Urban Mobility;+2;Ensuring affordable food can reinforce the need for sustainable urban mobility solutions, as people may rely more on public transportation or active mobility to access affordable food options, aiding the achievement of urban mobility targets.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+1;Protecting workers' rights and promoting fair income can enable the development of more sustainable and equitable maritime transport systems, creating conditions that further the achievement of net-zero technology targets.
Food quality;TA5.30,TA5.32;Biofuels;-2;Improving food quality and reducing food waste can counteract the production of biofuels, as food waste can be used to produce biofuels, limiting options for biofuel production.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29;Rail;+1;Promoting animal welfare in food production can enable the development of more sustainable food systems, which can in turn support the transportation of goods by rail, creating conditions that further the achievement of rail targets.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+2;Improving food quality and promoting healthy diets can reinforce the need for sustainable food production and transportation systems, which can aid the achievement of targets related to other low-carbon fuels.
