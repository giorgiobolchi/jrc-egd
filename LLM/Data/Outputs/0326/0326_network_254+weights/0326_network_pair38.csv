Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;Reinforcing;Improving air quality can aid in the recycling process of municipal waste by reducing pollution, thus reinforcing the circularity and recycling targets.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;Reinforcing;Enhancing water quality can facilitate more efficient waste reduction and management in municipal settings, supporting the goals of waste reduction.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+1;Enabling;Soil health improvement can create conditions for more sustainable critical raw material extraction and recycling, such as for batteries, enabling a more circular economy.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;-1;Constraining;Noise reduction targets might limit options for manufacturing processes in achieving net-zero technology, as some manufacturing could be noise-intensive.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+2;Reinforcing;Improving sanitation can reinforce efforts to reduce food waste by ensuring proper waste management and hygiene practices, which are critical for food handling and preparation.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+1;Enabling;Better air quality can enable a healthier environment for implementing waste reduction strategies for plastic and packaging, potentially increasing public engagement and participation.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+2;Reinforcing;Cleaner water can reinforce the recycling and circularity of plastics and packaging by ensuring that water used in these processes is of high quality, reducing contamination risks.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+1;Enabling;Healthy soils can enable more sustainable extraction and import practices for critical raw materials, potentially reducing environmental impacts.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;-1;Constraining;Noise reduction measures might constrain municipal waste management operations, such as recycling facilities, which could generate significant noise.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Circularity/Recycling;-2;Counteracting;Sanitation improvements might counteract circularity and recycling efforts if not properly aligned, for example, by generating waste that is not recyclable or reusable.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;+1;Enabling;Clean air can contribute to a healthier environment for textile production and recycling, potentially enhancing the quality and durability of recycled textiles.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7;Waste Reduction;-2;Counteracting;Water quality improvement efforts might counteract waste reduction strategies if they lead to increased water usage or pollution in the waste management process.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+1;Enabling;Soil health can enable more efficient and sustainable manufacturing processes, including those aiming for net-zero emissions, by providing natural resources and ecosystem services that support these goals.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;-1;Constraining;Noise reduction targets could constrain food waste reduction efforts, particularly in urban areas where noise from food waste collection and processing might be a concern.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+2;Reinforcing;Improved sanitation can reinforce the recycling of critical raw materials like those in batteries by ensuring a clean and healthy environment for recycling operations, which is crucial for the quality of recycled materials.
