GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Air Quality;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can lead to improved air quality by decreasing the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere, which in turn can have positive effects on human health and the environment.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Water Quality;+1;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate climate change, which can lead to more stable and predictable water cycles, ultimately improving water quality.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Improve Soils Health;-1;The implementation of energy-efficient buildings might lead to increased construction activities, potentially resulting in soil degradation and erosion if not managed sustainably.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Improve Air Quality;+3;GHG removal technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, can directly reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is essential for improving air quality and mitigating climate change.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Noise Reduction;-2;The transition to renewable energy sources and increased energy efficiency might lead to the installation of new infrastructure, such as wind turbines, which can generate noise pollution, counteracting efforts to reduce noise.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Social Security - Sanitation;+1;Electrification of transportation can lead to reduced air pollution in urban areas, which can improve public health and sanitation, especially in densely populated areas.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Improve Water Quality;+2;Enhancing climate resilience can involve measures to protect and restore natural ecosystems like wetlands, which play a crucial role in water filtration and purification, thus improving water quality.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Forest Bioeconomy;-1;The push for GHG reduction might lead to an increased demand for bioenergy, potentially resulting in over-exploitation of forests if not managed sustainably, which could negatively impact the forest bioeconomy.
