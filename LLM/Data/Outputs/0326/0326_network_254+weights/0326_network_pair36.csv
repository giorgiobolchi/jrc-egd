Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;GHG Reduction;-1;The improvement of air quality can constrain GHG reduction efforts by limiting the options for energy production and consumption, as cleaner energy sources may not always be available or affordable. This can lead to a trade-off between air quality and GHG reduction goals.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14,TA7.15,TA7.2,TA7.23,TA7.24,TA7.4,TA7.7;GHG Reduction;-1;The improvement of water quality can constrain GHG reduction efforts by limiting the use of water-intensive energy production methods, such as hydroelectric power, which can be an important source of renewable energy. This can lead to a trade-off between water quality and GHG reduction goals.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Removal;+2;The improvement of soils health can reinforce GHG removal efforts by enhancing the carbon sequestration potential of soils, which can help to mitigate climate change. This can lead to a win-win situation where both soil health and GHG removal goals are achieved.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;GHG Reduction;-2;The reduction of noise pollution can counteract GHG reduction efforts by limiting the use of certain transportation modes, such as electric vehicles, which can be an important source of renewable energy. This can lead to a trade-off between noise reduction and GHG reduction goals.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;GHG Reduction;-1;The improvement of social security and sanitation can constrain GHG reduction efforts by increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from sanitation and wastewater treatment processes. This can lead to a trade-off between social security and GHG reduction goals.
Forest Bioeconomy;TA1.1,TA1.4,TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.5;GHG Reduction;+1;The development of a forest bioeconomy can enable GHG reduction efforts by providing a source of renewable energy and materials, which can help to mitigate climate change. This can lead to a win-win situation where both forest bioeconomy and GHG reduction goals are achieved.
