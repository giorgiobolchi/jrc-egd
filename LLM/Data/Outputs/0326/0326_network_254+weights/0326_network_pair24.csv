GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Climate Resilience;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can aid in achieving climate resilience by mitigating the effects of climate change, thus reinforcing the ability to adapt to its impacts.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;GHG Reduction;+1;Reducing pesticide use can lead to more sustainable agricultural practices, which in turn can contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, thus enabling the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;GHG Reduction - Buildings;-1;The focus on competitive agriculture might lead to increased energy consumption in agricultural buildings and processes, potentially constraining the efforts to reduce GHG emissions from buildings.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;GHG Removal;+1;Protecting workers' rights and ensuring fair income can lead to more stable and equitable societies, which can in turn support policies and practices that remove greenhouse gases, such as through sustainable land use and reforestation.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;GHG Reduction - Transports;+2;Ensuring food affordability can lead to reduced food waste and more efficient food distribution systems, which can reinforce efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;GHG Reduction;+1;Promoting healthy food options can lead to dietary changes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as lower meat consumption, thus enabling the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;GHG Reduction;+1;Improving animal welfare in agriculture can lead to more sustainable farming practices, which can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus enabling the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
