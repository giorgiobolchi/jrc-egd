GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can reinforce waste reduction efforts by promoting sustainable practices and reducing energy consumption, which in turn can aid in achieving municipal waste reduction targets.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.5,TA6.9,TA6.26,TA7.10;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;-1;The reduction of pesticides can constrain the options for critical raw materials recycling, as some pesticides may be used in the extraction or processing of these materials, limiting the availability of recyclable materials.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;Competitive agriculture can enable food waste reduction by promoting efficient agricultural practices, reducing food losses, and creating conditions for sustainable food systems.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+2;Social security measures for workers can reinforce responsible critical raw materials extraction and import practices, ensuring that workers' rights are protected and promoting sustainable supply chains.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;Food quality;+2;Policies aimed at ensuring food affordability can also reinforce food quality by promoting sustainable agriculture, reducing food waste, and improving access to nutritious food, which can aid in achieving food quality targets.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;-2;Improving animal welfare in food production can counteract circularity and recycling efforts in municipal waste management, as it may require changes in production and consumption patterns that could increase waste generation.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+1;Promoting healthy food options can enable waste reduction in plastic and packaging by encouraging sustainable consumption patterns, reducing food packaging waste, and creating conditions for a circular economy.
