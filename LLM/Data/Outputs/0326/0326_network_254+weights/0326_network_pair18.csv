GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Climate Resilience;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can aid in achieving climate resilience by mitigating the effects of climate change, thus reinforcing the ability to adapt to its impacts.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;GHG Removal;-1;The focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions might limit options for removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, as resources and efforts could be directed more towards reduction rather than removal, thus constraining the achievement of GHG removal targets.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29;GHG Reduction;+3;The development and implementation of net-zero technology in road vehicles, such as electric vehicles, is inextricably linked to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector, as it directly contributes to decreasing emissions from vehicle use.
Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;TA4.33,TA4.34,TA4.45,TA4.57,TA4.58;GHG Reduction;+3;Similar to road vehicles, the adoption of net-zero technologies in maritime transport is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, thereby directly supporting the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;GHG Reduction;+2;The use of biofuels can aid in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, as they offer a lower-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, thus reinforcing efforts to decrease emissions.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;GHG Reduction;+2;The distribution and use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier can support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in sectors difficult to decarbonize, by providing a low-carbon energy source, thus reinforcing GHG reduction efforts.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;GHG Reduction;+1;Improvements in urban mobility, such as promoting walking, cycling, and public transport, can enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by creating conditions that favor lower-carbon transportation options.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;GHG Reduction;+1;Efficient transport logistics can enable GHG reduction by optimizing routes, reducing fuel consumption, and promoting the use of cleaner vehicles, thus creating favorable conditions for lowering emissions.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;GHG Reduction;+2;The development and use of other low-carbon fuels can reinforce GHG reduction efforts by offering alternatives to fossil fuels, thereby decreasing emissions from energy use.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;GHG Reduction;+1;The promotion of rail transport can enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transport by encouraging a shift towards a more energy-efficient mode of transportation, thus supporting conditions for lower emissions.
