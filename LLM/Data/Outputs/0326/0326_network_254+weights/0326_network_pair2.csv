GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector can be achieved through the adoption of net-zero technology in road vehicles, such as electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which can significantly reduce emissions and contribute to a cleaner transportation system. This synergy can aid in the achievement of both GHG reduction and net-zero technology targets.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+2;Similar to road vehicles, the implementation of net-zero technologies in maritime transport, such as alternative fuels or more efficient ship designs, can help reduce GHG emissions from this sector, thereby supporting the overall goal of GHG reduction and promoting cleaner maritime operations.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biofuels;+1;The use of biofuels can offer a lower-carbon alternative to traditional fossil fuels in various transportation modes, thus enabling a reduction in GHG emissions. However, the impact may vary depending on the source and production process of the biofuels, making it an enabling factor rather than a direct solution.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+1;Improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing their GHG emissions can indirectly support the transition to net-zero technologies in road vehicles by reducing the overall energy demand and promoting a cleaner energy mix. This can create a more favorable environment for the adoption of electric vehicles.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Hydrogen Distribution;+2;The removal of GHG from the atmosphere can be facilitated through technologies that utilize hydrogen, such as carbon capture and storage coupled with hydrogen production. The distribution of hydrogen can play a critical role in making this technology accessible for various applications, including energy production and industrial processes, thereby reinforcing efforts in both GHG removal and hydrogen distribution.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Urban Mobility;+1;Urban mobility strategies that promote walking, cycling, and the use of public transport can contribute to reducing GHG emissions from the transport sector. By encouraging these modes of transportation, cities can lower their carbon footprint and support the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.11,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Transport Logistics;+2;Efficient transport logistics can significantly reduce GHG emissions by optimizing routes, reducing fuel consumption, and promoting the use of cleaner vehicles. This can directly contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector, making it a reinforcing factor for GHG reduction targets in transportation.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Rail;+1;Investing in rail infrastructure can enhance climate resilience by providing a more reliable and less weather-dependent mode of transportation compared to roads. This can enable the continuous operation of supply chains and passenger services during extreme weather events, supporting both climate resilience and the development of sustainable transport options.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+1;The development and use of other low-carbon fuels, such as advanced biofuels or synthetic fuels, can offer alternatives to fossil fuels in various sectors, including transport and industry, thereby contributing to GHG reduction. However, their production and use must be carefully managed to avoid unintended environmental impacts.
