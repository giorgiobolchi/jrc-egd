GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can aid in the reduction of waste by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the need for landfills, which in turn can help achieve waste reduction targets.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;GHG reduction efforts can reinforce circular economy practices in municipal waste management, such as recycling and composting, leading to a more sustainable waste management system.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.40,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+1;The promotion of net-zero technology in road vehicles can enable the reduction of plastic waste by encouraging the use of alternative materials and promoting sustainable transportation practices.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.40,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+1;The development of net-zero road vehicles can create conditions for a more circular economy in plastic and packaging by reducing the demand for single-use plastics and promoting the use of recycled materials.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+2;The production and use of biofuels can aid in the reduction of dependence on critical raw materials by promoting the use of renewable energy sources and reducing the need for fossil fuels.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;-1;The increased demand for biofuels can constrain the development of net-zero technologies in manufacturing by competing for resources and investment, potentially limiting the growth of more sustainable industries.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;The use of other low-carbon fuels can enable the reduction of food waste by promoting more efficient food production and distribution systems, as well as encouraging the use of food waste as a feedstock for energy production.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+2;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure can reinforce the recycling of critical raw materials in batteries by promoting the use of sustainable energy storage solutions and reducing electronic waste.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;The promotion of urban mobility can create conditions for reducing municipal waste by encouraging the use of shared transportation services, reducing the number of private vehicles on the road, and promoting more efficient waste collection systems.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.40,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;The optimization of transport logistics can aid in the reduction of municipal waste by promoting more efficient packaging, reducing transportation emissions, and encouraging the use of recycled materials in packaging.
