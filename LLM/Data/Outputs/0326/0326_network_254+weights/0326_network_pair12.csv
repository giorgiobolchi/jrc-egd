Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;GHG Reduction;+2;The reduction of municipal waste can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration are significant contributors to GHG emissions. Effective waste reduction strategies can reinforce GHG reduction efforts.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;GHG Reduction;+2;Reducing food waste can lower GHG emissions from agricultural production, transportation, and storage. This can reinforce GHG reduction targets by decreasing the demand for resource-intensive food production.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;GHG Reduction;+2;Improving recycling rates and reducing waste sent to landfills can decrease GHG emissions from waste management. This can aid in achieving GHG reduction targets by minimizing the environmental impact of waste disposal.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;GHG Reduction;+1;Responsible extraction and import of critical raw materials can enable the production of clean technologies, such as renewable energy systems and energy storage, which are crucial for reducing GHG emissions. This can create conditions that further GHG reduction efforts.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;GHG Reduction;+3;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, are inextricably linked to achieving GHG reduction targets. These technologies are essential for reducing emissions from industrial sources.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;GHG Reduction;+2;Recycling critical raw materials from batteries can reduce the need for primary material extraction, which is often energy-intensive and contributes to GHG emissions. This can reinforce GHG reduction efforts by decreasing the carbon footprint of material production.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.30,TA3.40;GHG Removal;+1;Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling rates can decrease GHG emissions from production and disposal of plastic products. This can create conditions that further GHG removal efforts by minimizing waste-related emissions.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;GHG Reduction;+2;Improving circularity and recycling rates can reduce the demand for virgin materials, decrease waste, and lower GHG emissions from production processes. This can reinforce GHG reduction targets by promoting more efficient use of resources.
