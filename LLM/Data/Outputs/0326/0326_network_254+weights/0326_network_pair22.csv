GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can aid in the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems by mitigating climate change, which can have a reinforcing effect on the health and biodiversity of these ecosystems.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+2;Similar to terrestrial ecosystems, reducing GHG emissions can help restore marine ecosystems by reducing ocean acidification and mitigating the impacts of climate change, thus reinforcing efforts in marine conservation.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-1;The production of biofuels, particularly from agricultural sources, can constrain the restoration of agricultural ecosystems due to land use competition and potential environmental impacts from large-scale farming.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;-1;Biofuel production can lead to habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity, especially if not managed sustainably, thus constraining biodiversity conservation efforts.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+3;Hydrogen distribution is indivisible from the development and implementation of hydrogen fuel cell technology in road vehicles, as it provides the necessary infrastructure for these vehicles to operate.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+3;Similarly, hydrogen distribution infrastructure is crucial for the adoption of hydrogen fuel cells in maritime transport, making it an indivisible component of this sub-theme.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;Transport Logistics;+2;Improving urban mobility through sustainable and efficient transport systems can reinforce the development of transport logistics by reducing congestion, emissions, and increasing the reliability of goods movement.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;Efficient transport logistics can aid in the transition to net-zero technology in road vehicles by optimizing routes, reducing fuel consumption, and promoting the use of alternative fuels or electric vehicles.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.40,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+1;The transition to net-zero technology in road vehicles can enable biodiversity conservation by reducing air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the environmental impact of transportation, thus creating conditions that further biodiversity protection.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.40,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+1;Similarly, the adoption of net-zero technologies in road vehicles can enable the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems by reducing pollution and climate change impacts, thereby creating favorable conditions for ecosystem health and biodiversity.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;-1;The production and use of other low-carbon fuels, such as those from marine sources, can constrain marine ecosystem restoration due to potential environmental impacts, such as pollution or habitat disruption.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;-1;The development of low-carbon fuels from marine sources can also impact fisheries and marine biodiversity, constraining conservation efforts in these areas.
