Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Air Quality;+2;The reduction of municipal waste can lead to a decrease in air pollution, as less waste is burned or decomposed, releasing harmful gases into the atmosphere. This, in turn, can improve air quality.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Water Quality;+2;Proper waste management can prevent pollution of water sources, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in rivers, lakes, and oceans. This can improve water quality and protect aquatic ecosystems.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Improve Soils Health;+1;Recycling and composting of municipal waste can help to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, which can contaminate soil and groundwater. This can help to improve soil health and reduce the risk of pollution.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Improve Air Quality;-1;The extraction and processing of critical raw materials can lead to air pollution, as these activities often involve the release of harmful gases and particles into the atmosphere. This can negatively impact air quality.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Improve Water Quality;+1;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies, such as renewable energy systems and energy-efficient appliances, can help to reduce water pollution by decreasing the amount of waste generated during the production process. This can improve water quality and protect aquatic ecosystems.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Improve Soils Health;+2;The recycling of batteries and other electronic waste can help to reduce the amount of toxic materials that end up in landfills and contaminate soil and groundwater. This can improve soil health and reduce the risk of pollution.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;Improve Water Quality;+1;Reducing food waste can help to decrease the amount of organic waste that ends up in landfills, which can produce methane and contaminate water sources. This can improve water quality and protect aquatic ecosystems.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.30,TA3.40;Improve Soils Health;+1;Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling rates can help to decrease the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and contaminate soil and groundwater. This can improve soil health and reduce the risk of pollution.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;Improve Air Quality;+1;The recycling of textile waste can help to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, which can produce methane and other harmful gases. This can improve air quality and reduce the risk of pollution.
Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37,TA3.39,TA3.40;Improve Water Quality;+2;The recycling of plastic waste can help to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in oceans and waterways, which can harm aquatic life and contaminate the water supply. This can improve water quality and protect aquatic ecosystems.
