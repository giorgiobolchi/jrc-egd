Improve Air Quality;TA2.13,TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.17,TA2.18,TA2.19,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Renewable Energy;+;2;Improving air quality can aid the development and implementation of renewable energy sources by reducing air pollution, which can damage equipment and infrastructure. This can reinforce the growth of the renewable energy sector.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7,TA7.14,TA7.15;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;1;Improving water quality can create conditions that further the production of renewable energy from hydrogen, as clean water is necessary for the production process. This can enable the growth of the hydrogen production sector.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Energy Efficiency;+;2;Improving soil health can aid the development of energy-efficient practices in agriculture, such as reducing synthetic fertilizer use and promoting soil carbon sequestration. This can reinforce the growth of the energy efficiency sector.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Social Security - Energy;-;1;Reducing noise pollution can constrain the development of certain energy infrastructure, such as wind turbines, which can be noisy. This can limit options for energy production and distribution.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;1;Improving sanitation can create conditions that further the development of solar energy, as clean water and sanitation are necessary for the maintenance and operation of solar panels. This can enable the growth of the solar energy sector.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;+;2;Improving soil health can aid the development of renewable heating and cooling systems, such as district heating and cooling systems, which can be more efficient and environmentally friendly. This can reinforce the growth of the heating and cooling sector.
Forest Bioeconomy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;1;The forest bioeconomy can create conditions that further the development of energy-efficient buildings, as wood and other forest products can be used as sustainable building materials. This can enable the growth of the energy-efficient buildings sector.
