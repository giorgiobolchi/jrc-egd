Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.62,TA6.8;GHG Reduction;-2;The implementation of biodiversity protection and conservation targets may counteract GHG reduction efforts, as some conservation measures may require significant energy consumption or land use changes that increase emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;GHG Reduction;-1;Urban nature conservation efforts may constrain GHG reduction options, as urban green spaces may require energy-intensive maintenance or limit the availability of land for renewable energy installations.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;GHG Removal;+2;Forest restoration can aid in GHG removal by sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reinforcing the effectiveness of GHG removal strategies.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;GHG Reduction;+1;Sustainable agricultural practices can enable GHG reduction by promoting soil carbon sequestration, reducing synthetic fertilizer use, and enhancing ecosystem services that support climate regulation.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;GHG Reduction;-1;Marine ecosystem restoration may constrain GHG reduction options, as some restoration efforts may require significant energy consumption or limit the availability of ocean spaces for renewable energy installations.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;GHG Reduction;-2;Fisheries management and conservation efforts may counteract GHG reduction efforts, as some fishing practices or gear may contribute to emissions or limit the effectiveness of marine renewable energy installations.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;GHG Reduction;+1;Effective monitoring of biodiversity can enable GHG reduction by providing insights into ecosystem functioning and identifying areas where conservation efforts can support climate regulation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;GHG Removal;+3;Terrestrial ecosystem restoration is inextricably linked to GHG removal, as restored ecosystems can sequester significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making it impossible to achieve GHG removal targets without ecosystem restoration.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;GHG Reduction;+1;River restoration can enable GHG reduction by promoting ecosystem services that support climate regulation, such as floodplain restoration and wetland conservation, which can aid in carbon sequestration and reduce emissions.
