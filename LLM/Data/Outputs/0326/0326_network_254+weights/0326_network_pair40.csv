Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14,TA7.15,TA7.2,TA7.23,TA7.24,TA7.4,TA7.7;Food quality;+2;The improvement of water quality can reinforce the achievement of food quality targets by reducing the risk of water-borne diseases and improving the overall health of the food system.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14,TA7.15,TA7.2,TA7.23,TA7.24,TA7.4,TA7.7;Food affordability;-1;The improvement of water quality may constrain the options for food affordability by increasing the costs of water treatment and management, which could be passed on to consumers.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Competitive Agriculture;+2;The improvement of soils health can reinforce the achievement of competitive agriculture targets by increasing crop yields, improving soil fertility, and reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Pesticides Reduction;+3;The improvement of soils health is indivisible from the reduction of pesticides, as healthy soils can support more diverse and resilient ecosystems, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+1;The reduction of noise pollution can enable the achievement of food quality and animal welfare targets by improving the living conditions of farm animals and reducing stress, which can lead to better animal health and welfare.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Food affordability;+1;The improvement of sanitation can enable the achievement of food affordability targets by reducing the risk of food-borne diseases and improving the overall health of the population, which can lead to reduced healthcare costs and improved economic productivity.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Food quality;+2;The improvement of sanitation can reinforce the achievement of food quality targets by reducing the risk of food-borne diseases and improving the overall health of the food system.
GHG Reduction;TA1.10,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA1.14,TA1.16,TA1.3,TA1.6,TA1.7,TA1.8,TA1.9,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17,TA4.3,TA4.37,TA4.43,TA4.51,TA4.56;Competitive Agriculture;-2;The reduction of GHG emissions may counteract the achievement of competitive agriculture targets by increasing the costs of production, particularly for farmers who rely heavily on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which can lead to reduced crop yields and lower profitability.
GHG Reduction;TA1.10,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA1.14,TA1.16,TA1.3,TA1.6,TA1.7,TA1.8,TA1.9,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17,TA4.3,TA4.37,TA4.43,TA4.51,TA4.56;Pesticides Reduction;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can reinforce the achievement of pesticides reduction targets by promoting more sustainable and environmentally-friendly agricultural practices, such as organic farming and agroecology, which can reduce the need for synthetic pesticides.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Food quality;+1;The improvement of air quality can enable the achievement of food quality targets by reducing the risk of air-borne diseases and improving the overall health of the food system.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Food affordability;-1;The improvement of air quality may constrain the options for food affordability by increasing the costs of air pollution control and management, which could be passed on to consumers.
