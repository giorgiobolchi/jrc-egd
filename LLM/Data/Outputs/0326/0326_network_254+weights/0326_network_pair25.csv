GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is closely linked to the increase in renewable energy production, as renewable energy sources are a key component of a low-carbon economy. The implementation of GHG reduction targets will likely reinforce the development and use of renewable energy.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Energy Efficiency;+2;Improving energy efficiency is a crucial step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the implementation of GHG reduction targets will likely aid in the achievement of energy efficiency goals. Energy-efficient technologies and practices can help reduce energy consumption, which in turn reduces emissions.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Food affordability;+1;The development of competitive agriculture can enable the production of high-quality, affordable food, which can contribute to food affordability. By promoting sustainable and efficient agricultural practices, the EU can help ensure a stable food supply and reduce the risk of food price volatility.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Food quality;+2;Reducing the use of pesticides is essential for ensuring food quality and safety. The implementation of pesticide reduction targets can help minimize the presence of harmful chemicals in food products, which can have positive impacts on human health and the environment.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Social Security - Energy;+1;The protection of workers' rights and social security can have a positive impact on the energy sector, particularly in terms of ensuring fair working conditions and safe operations. By promoting social security and workers' protection, the EU can help create a more stable and equitable energy workforce.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Food quality - Healthy Food;+2;Improving animal welfare in the food production process can have a positive impact on food quality and safety. By promoting better animal welfare practices, the EU can help reduce the risk of animal-borne diseases and improve the overall quality of food products.
