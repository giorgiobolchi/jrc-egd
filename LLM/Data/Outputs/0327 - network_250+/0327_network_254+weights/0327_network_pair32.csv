Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;The protection of biodiversity can enable waste reduction by preserving ecosystems that help to maintain soil quality, air quality, and water quality, which in turn can reduce the amount of waste generated.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Circularity/Recycling;+2;Biodiversity protection can reinforce circularity and recycling by preserving natural resources, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable consumption patterns.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-1;The restoration of forests can constrain the extraction and import of critical raw materials by limiting the land available for mining and promoting sustainable land use practices.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+3;The restoration of marine ecosystems is indivisible from the development of net-zero technologies, as healthy oceans are essential for the production of renewable energy and the mitigation of climate change.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+1;The protection of urban nature can enable circularity and recycling in municipal waste management by promoting green infrastructure, reducing waste generation, and increasing recycling rates.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+2;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can reinforce waste reduction in food waste by promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reducing food loss, and increasing food recovery.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;-2;The protection of fisheries can counteract the recycling of critical raw materials in batteries by limiting the availability of materials for recycling and promoting the use of primary materials.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.11,TA5.13,TA5.15,TA6.9,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Waste Reduction;-1;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can constrain waste reduction efforts by limiting the land available for waste management and promoting sustainable land use practices.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;+1;The monitoring of biodiversity can enable the recycling of textile waste by promoting sustainable consumption patterns, reducing waste generation, and increasing recycling rates.
