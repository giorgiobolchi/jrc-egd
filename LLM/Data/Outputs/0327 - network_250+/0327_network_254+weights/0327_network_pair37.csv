GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;+;3;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in List A can positively influence the achievement of Renewable Energy targets in List B, as reducing greenhouse gas emissions often involves increasing the use of renewable energy sources. This is an indivisible connection, as renewable energy is a crucial component of GHG reduction strategies.

GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Energy Efficiency;+;3;GHG reduction targets can also reinforce Energy Efficiency targets, as improving energy efficiency is often a key strategy for reducing energy consumption and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions. This connection is reinforcing, as energy efficiency measures can aid in the achievement of GHG reduction goals.

Improve Air Quality;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA7.8;Renewable Energy;+;2;Improving air quality can be aided by the increased use of renewable energy sources, which typically produce little to no air pollution. This connection is reinforcing, as renewable energy can help reduce air pollution from fossil fuels.

Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7,TA7.6;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;1;Improving water quality can be enabled by the use of renewable energy sources for hydrogen production, which can help reduce pollution from industrial processes. This connection is enabling, as the use of renewable energy for hydrogen production can create conditions that further improve water quality.

Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;1;Improving soil health can be enabled by energy efficiency measures in buildings, which can reduce the energy needed for heating and cooling, subsequently reducing the demand for fossil fuels and the associated environmental impacts. This connection is enabling, as energy-efficient buildings can create conditions that further improve soil health.

Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Social Security - Energy;+;1;Reducing noise pollution can be enabled by the use of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies, which can help reduce noise from energy generation and consumption. This connection is enabling, as the use of renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies can create conditions that further reduce noise pollution.

Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3,TA7.9;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;1;Improving social security through sanitation can be enabled by the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar power, for water treatment and sanitation systems. This connection is enabling, as the use of renewable energy can create conditions that further improve sanitation and social security.
