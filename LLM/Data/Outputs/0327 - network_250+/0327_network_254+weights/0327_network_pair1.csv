GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can be reinforced by the adoption of circular economy practices, such as recycling and reuse, which can lead to a decrease in the production of new materials and the associated emissions. This connection is particularly relevant for targets like TA1.3, which aims to reduce GHG emissions from buildings, and TA1.7, which focuses on reducing methane emissions.

GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-1;The extraction and import of critical raw materials can be constrained by the reduction of GHG emissions, as some of these materials may be associated with high emissions during their production and transportation. This could limit the options for achieving some of the GHG reduction targets, such as TA1.9, which aims to reduce emissions from industrial processes.

GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+1;The reduction of GHG emissions from transportation can be enabled by the reduction of plastic and packaging waste, as this can lead to a decrease in the production of new plastics and the associated emissions. This connection is particularly relevant for targets like TA1.10, which aims to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, and TA4.12, which focuses on reducing GHG intensity in the maritime sector.

GHG Removal;TA7.8;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+2;The development of net-zero technologies can reinforce the removal of GHG emissions from the atmosphere, as these technologies can be used to capture and utilize CO2. This connection is particularly relevant for targets like TA7.8, which aims to remove GHG emissions through technological means.

GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+1;The reduction of GHG emissions from buildings can be enabled by the adoption of circular economy practices in the construction sector, such as recycling and reuse of materials. This connection is particularly relevant for targets like TA1.15, which aims to reduce emissions from buildings.

GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions from transportation can be reinforced by the recycling and reuse of critical raw materials, such as those used in batteries for electric vehicles. This connection is particularly relevant for targets like TA1.10, which aims to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, and TA4.12, which focuses on reducing GHG intensity in the maritime sector.
