GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can reinforce waste reduction efforts by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the environmental impact of waste management.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;GHG reduction targets can aid in the development of circular economy practices, such as recycling and composting, which in turn can reduce waste sent to landfills and lower emissions.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.40,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+1;The promotion of zero-emission vehicles can enable a reduction in plastic waste from vehicle manufacturing and packaging, as companies may adopt more sustainable materials and designs.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.40,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+2;The development of zero-emission vehicles can drive the demand for recycled critical raw materials, such as lithium and cobalt, which are essential for battery production, thus reinforcing recycling efforts.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;The production of biofuels from organic waste can help reduce food waste by utilizing waste materials that would otherwise be discarded, thus enabling a more circular economy.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+1;The use of low-carbon fuels, such as those derived from waste plastics, can support the reduction of plastic waste and promote a more circular economy in the packaging sector.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+2;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure can drive the demand for critical raw materials, such as platinum and iridium, which are used in fuel cells and electrolyzers, thus reinforcing the extraction and import of these materials.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;The promotion of active mobility, such as cycling and walking, can reduce the amount of waste generated by transportation, including plastic waste from packaging and food waste from single-use items.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;The optimization of transport logistics can aid in the reduction of waste by promoting more efficient packaging, reducing food waste through better supply chain management, and encouraging the use of recyclable materials.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;The development of rail infrastructure can support the reduction of waste by promoting the use of more efficient and environmentally friendly transportation modes, which can lead to a decrease in packaging waste and emissions.
