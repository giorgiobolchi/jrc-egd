Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Food quality;+;2;The protection and restoration of biodiversity can aid in the preservation of ecosystem services that are essential for food production and quality. This can include pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling, all of which can contribute to healthier and more sustainable food systems.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Food affordability;+;1;The conservation of biodiversity can help maintain ecosystem resilience, which is crucial for ensuring stable and sustainable food systems. This, in turn, can contribute to more affordable food options by reducing the risks of crop failures and promoting more efficient agricultural practices.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Food quality - Healthy Food;+;1;Urban nature and green spaces can provide numerous benefits for human health and wellbeing, including improved air quality, reduced noise pollution, and increased access to recreational areas. These benefits can contribute to healthier lifestyles and dietary choices, ultimately supporting the goals of healthy food initiatives.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Pesticides Reduction;+;2;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can involve practices like organic farming and agroforestry, which often require reduced or no use of pesticides. This can lead to a decrease in pesticide usage, aligning with the goals of pesticide reduction initiatives.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Competitive Agriculture;+;1;The restoration of forests can contribute to improved soil health, increased biodiversity, and enhanced ecosystem services like pollination and pest control. These benefits can make agricultural practices more competitive and sustainable in the long run.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+;1;The restoration of marine ecosystems can help maintain the health and biodiversity of marine species, which are often used in animal feed or directly consumed. Healthy marine ecosystems can contribute to better animal welfare by ensuring that the food chain is sustainable and resilient.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Food affordability;+;1;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices, which are crucial for biodiversity conservation in fisheries, can also contribute to more stable and affordable food prices by reducing the risk of overfishing and promoting more efficient use of marine resources.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Food quality - Monitoring;+;2;Effective monitoring of biodiversity can provide valuable insights into the health of ecosystems, which is essential for ensuring the quality and safety of food production. This monitoring can help identify areas where conservation efforts are needed to protect ecosystem services that support agriculture and food systems.
