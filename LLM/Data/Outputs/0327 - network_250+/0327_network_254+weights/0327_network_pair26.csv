GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can reinforce waste reduction efforts by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the environmental impact of waste management.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling;+2;GHG reduction targets can aid the development of circular economy practices, which in turn can lead to more efficient use of resources and reduced waste.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;Reducing pesticide use can lead to more sustainable agricultural practices, which can in turn reduce food waste by promoting more efficient farming methods.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Food affordability;+1;Improving agricultural competitiveness can lead to increased food production and availability, making food more affordable for consumers.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;Protecting workers' rights and promoting fair labor practices can lead to better working conditions in waste management, which can in turn improve waste reduction efforts.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+2;Promoting healthy food options can lead to reduced packaging waste, as consumers opt for products with minimal or biodegradable packaging, which can be recycled or composted.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;-1;Policies aimed at ensuring food affordability might constrain efforts to reduce food waste, as they may prioritize food availability and accessibility over sustainability.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;-2;The reduction of pesticide use might counteract the development of circular economy practices for critical raw materials, as the focus shifts from reducing waste to promoting sustainable agriculture.
