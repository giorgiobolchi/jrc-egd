Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Water Quality;+2;The reduction of waste can lead to a decrease in water pollution, which in turn can improve water quality. This is because waste reduction targets, such as those outlined in TA3.1 and TA3.2, can help minimize the amount of waste that enters waterways.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Air Quality;+1;Reducing municipal waste can lead to a decrease in air pollution from waste management activities, such as landfilling and incineration, which can improve air quality. This is because municipal waste reduction targets, such as those outlined in TA3.1 and TA3.2, can help minimize the amount of waste that is burned or landfilled.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;Improve Soils Health;+2;Reducing food waste can lead to a decrease in the amount of organic waste that enters landfills, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve soil health. This is because food waste reduction targets, such as those outlined in TA3.24 and TA3.25, can help minimize the amount of food waste that is generated and disposed of in landfills.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Improve Water Quality;+3;Reducing plastic waste can lead to a significant decrease in water pollution, which can improve water quality. This is because plastic waste reduction targets, such as those outlined in TA3.27 and TA3.28, can help minimize the amount of plastic waste that enters waterways and harms aquatic life.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;Improve Air Quality;+1;Increasing circularity and recycling can lead to a decrease in air pollution from production activities, which can improve air quality. This is because circularity and recycling targets, such as those outlined in TA3.3, can help minimize the amount of new raw materials that need to be extracted and processed.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Improve Water Quality;+2;Increasing circularity and recycling of municipal waste can lead to a decrease in water pollution, which can improve water quality. This is because municipal waste circularity and recycling targets, such as those outlined in TA3.20 and TA3.21, can help minimize the amount of waste that enters waterways.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Improve Soils Health;+1;Increasing circularity and recycling of textile waste can lead to a decrease in the amount of waste that enters landfills, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve soil health. This is because textile waste circularity and recycling targets, such as those outlined in TA3.15 and TA3.16, can help minimize the amount of textile waste that is generated and disposed of in landfills.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Improve Air Quality;+1;Reducing the extraction and import of critical raw materials can lead to a decrease in air pollution from mining and processing activities, which can improve air quality. This is because critical raw materials reduction targets, such as those outlined in TA3.10 and TA3.11, can help minimize the amount of raw materials that need to be extracted and processed.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Improve Air Quality;+2;Increasing the use of net-zero technologies in manufacturing can lead to a significant decrease in air pollution from production activities, which can improve air quality. This is because net-zero technology targets, such as those outlined in TA3.12, can help minimize the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing activities.
