GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in the transportation sector can aid the development of net-zero technology for road vehicles, as it promotes the use of alternative fuels and encourages the adoption of cleaner transportation methods.;The connection between GHG reduction and net-zero technology for road vehicles is based on the shared goal of reducing emissions and promoting sustainable transportation.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biofuels;+1;GHG reduction targets can create conditions that further the development of biofuels, as they encourage the use of alternative energy sources and promote sustainable land use.;The link between GHG reduction and biofuels is rooted in the need to reduce emissions from transportation and promote the use of renewable energy sources.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Transport Logistics;+2;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in the transportation sector can reinforce the development of sustainable transport logistics, as it promotes the use of cleaner transportation methods and encourages the adoption of more efficient supply chains.;The connection between GHG reduction in transportation and transport logistics is based on the shared goal of reducing emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices.
GHG Removal;TA1.12,TA7.8;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+1;GHG removal targets can create conditions that further the development of net-zero technology for maritime transport, as they encourage the use of alternative fuels and promote sustainable transportation methods.;The link between GHG removal and net-zero technology for maritime transport is rooted in the need to reduce emissions from transportation and promote the use of renewable energy sources.
Climate Resilience;TA1.4,TA5.18,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22;Urban Mobility;+2;The implementation of climate resilience targets can aid the development of sustainable urban mobility, as it promotes the use of green infrastructure and encourages the adoption of climate-resilient transportation methods.;The connection between climate resilience and urban mobility is based on the shared goal of reducing the impact of climate change on urban areas and promoting sustainable transportation practices.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15,TA1.6,TA1.14;Hydrogen Distribution;+1;GHG reduction targets in the building sector can create conditions that further the development of hydrogen distribution, as they encourage the use of alternative energy sources and promote sustainable building practices.;The link between GHG reduction in buildings and hydrogen distribution is rooted in the need to reduce emissions from buildings and promote the use of renewable energy sources.
