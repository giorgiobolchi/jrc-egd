Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;GHG Reduction;-2;The implementation of biodiversity protection and conservation targets may counteract GHG reduction efforts, as some conservation measures may require significant energy consumption or land use changes that increase emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;GHG Removal;+1;Biodiversity protection and conservation can enable GHG removal by preserving and restoring natural carbon sinks, such as forests and wetlands.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;GHG Reduction;+2;Restoring forests can reinforce GHG reduction efforts by sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;GHG Reduction;-1;The implementation of sustainable agricultural practices may constrain GHG reduction efforts, as some practices may require increased energy consumption or fertilizer use that increases emissions.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;GHG Reduction;+1;Restoring marine ecosystems can enable GHG reduction by promoting the growth of marine vegetation that absorbs carbon dioxide.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Climate Resilience;+2;Urban nature conservation can reinforce climate resilience by providing ecosystem services, such as air purification and temperature regulation, that help cities adapt to climate change.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;GHG Reduction;+1;Restoring rivers can enable GHG reduction by promoting the growth of aquatic vegetation that absorbs carbon dioxide.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;GHG Reduction;-1;Sustainable fishing practices may constrain GHG reduction efforts, as some practices may require increased energy consumption or fuel use that increases emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;GHG Reduction;+1;Monitoring biodiversity can enable GHG reduction by providing data on ecosystem health and carbon sequestration potential.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;GHG Reduction - Transports;-2;The implementation of biodiversity protection and conservation targets may counteract GHG reduction efforts in the transport sector, as some conservation measures may require significant land use changes that increase emissions from transportation.
