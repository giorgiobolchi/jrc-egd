GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;GHG Reduction;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the GHG Reduction sub-theme will reinforce the efforts to decrease emissions in the same sub-theme in List B, as both targets aim to minimize carbon footprint and promote sustainable development.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Food affordability;-1;The focus on competitive agriculture might constrain the achievement of food affordability, as the emphasis on agricultural productivity and competitiveness could lead to increased food prices, making it less accessible to vulnerable populations.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;GHG Reduction;+1;Reducing pesticide use can enable the achievement of GHG reduction targets, as pesticides contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and their reduction can lead to a decrease in emissions.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Food affordability;-2;The promotion of healthy food options might counteract the goal of food affordability, as healthier food options are often more expensive, making them less accessible to low-income households.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;GHG Reduction;+1;Protecting workers' rights and promoting social security can enable the achievement of GHG reduction targets, as a stable and secure workforce is more likely to invest in sustainable practices and support climate action.
Food quality;TA5.30,TA5.32;Food affordability;-1;The focus on food quality might constrain the achievement of food affordability, as high-quality food options are often more expensive, making them less accessible to vulnerable populations.
