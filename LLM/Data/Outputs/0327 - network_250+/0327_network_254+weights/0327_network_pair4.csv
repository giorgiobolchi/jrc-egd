GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can aid in the conservation of biodiversity by mitigating the effects of climate change on ecosystems, which in turn can help protect and restore natural habitats.;The connection between GHG reduction and biodiversity conservation is well-established, as climate change is a major driver of biodiversity loss.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;Efforts to reduce GHG emissions can reinforce terrestrial ecosystems restoration by promoting sustainable land use practices, such as reforestation and afforestation, which help sequester carbon dioxide.;Sustainable land use practices can contribute to both GHG reduction and ecosystem restoration.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+1;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can enable the creation of urban green spaces, which can help protect urban biodiversity and provide ecosystem services.;Urban green spaces can help mitigate the urban heat island effect and improve air quality, which can have positive impacts on urban biodiversity.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+1;Promoting sustainable transportation options, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, can reduce air pollution and help protect river ecosystems.;Reducing air pollution from transportation can help improve water quality and protect aquatic biodiversity.
GHG Removal;TA1.12,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+2;GHG removal strategies, such as carbon capture and storage, can reinforce marine ecosystem restoration by reducing ocean acidification and helping to protect marine biodiversity.;Ocean acidification is a major threat to marine ecosystems, and reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate this impact.
Climate Resilience;TA1.4,TA1.6;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;+1;Improving climate resilience can enable more effective monitoring and conservation of biodiversity by providing early warning systems for climate-related hazards and helping to protect vulnerable species.;Climate resilience is critical for protecting biodiversity, as climate change can have devastating impacts on ecosystems and species.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+1;Reducing GHG emissions can help protect marine ecosystems and fisheries by mitigating the effects of climate change on ocean ecosystems and helping to maintain healthy fish populations.;Climate change can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries, and reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate these effects.
