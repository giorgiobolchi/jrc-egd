GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions is closely linked to the development and deployment of net-zero technologies, including those for road vehicles, as they can significantly contribute to decreasing emissions in the transportation sector.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+2;Similar to road vehicles, net-zero technologies for maritime transport can aid in reducing GHG emissions from this sector, which is also a significant contributor to global emissions.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biofuels;+1;Biofuels can serve as a lower-carbon alternative to traditional fuels, thereby supporting the reduction of GHG emissions, although their overall impact depends on production methods and sources.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Transport Logistics;+1;Improving agricultural competitiveness can lead to increased efficiency in transportation and logistics for agricultural products, potentially reducing emissions and supporting more sustainable supply chains.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.5,TA5.10;Food quality - Healthy Food;+2;Reducing pesticide use can directly improve food quality by minimizing residues on crops, thus reinforcing the goal of achieving healthier food options.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+1;Ensuring food affordability can create conditions that support better animal welfare, as affordable and sustainable food systems may prioritize ethical treatment of animals.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Urban Mobility;+1;Protecting workers' rights and ensuring fair income can enable them to afford and access sustainable urban mobility options, contributing to a reduction in emissions and improved air quality.
Food quality;TA5.30,TA5.32;Net-Zero Technology - Aviation;-1;The focus on food quality might constrain options for aviation, as certain net-zero technologies might require significant land use changes or resource allocations that could impact food production areas.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.5,TA5.10;Rail;+1;Reducing pesticide use can create opportunities for more sustainable agricultural practices, which might be supported by rail transport as a more environmentally friendly option for moving goods.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+2;Competitive agriculture can reinforce the development and use of other low-carbon fuels by creating demand for sustainable energy sources in agricultural practices and supply chains.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Hydrogen Distribution;-2;Policies focusing on food affordability might counteract efforts to transition to hydrogen distribution, as the latter may require significant investments that could divert resources from ensuring affordable food options.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Transport Logistics;+2;Ensuring workers' protection and fair salaries can aid in the development of more sustainable and efficient transport logistics, as workers might be more inclined to support and participate in green initiatives when their rights are respected.
