GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;-2;The reduction of GHG emissions through the implementation of TA1.3, TA1.7, TA1.9, TA1.11, and TA1.13 may counteract the growth of renewable energy production, as it may lead to increased costs and reduced competitiveness of renewable energy sources.;The European Green Deal's focus on reducing GHG emissions may lead to a shift away from fossil fuels, which could negatively impact the development of renewable energy infrastructure.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Energy Efficiency;+2;The implementation of GHG reduction targets may reinforce energy efficiency measures, as reducing energy consumption is a key strategy for decreasing GHG emissions.;The reduction of GHG emissions through energy efficiency measures can lead to cost savings and increased competitiveness for businesses and industries.
GHG Removal;TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15;Renewable Energy;-1;The implementation of GHG removal targets may constrain the development of renewable energy sources, as it may lead to increased competition for land and resources.;The use of land for GHG removal, such as afforestation, may limit the availability of land for renewable energy production, such as wind farms or solar panels.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+3;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in buildings is indivisible from energy efficiency measures, as reducing energy consumption is a key strategy for decreasing GHG emissions in buildings.;The reduction of GHG emissions in buildings through energy efficiency measures can lead to cost savings and increased competitiveness for businesses and industries.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+1;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in transportation may enable the development of renewable energy sources, such as hydrogen production, as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels.;The use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel can reduce GHG emissions and improve air quality, making it an attractive option for cities and countries looking to reduce their environmental impact.
Climate Resilience;TA1.4,TA7.8;Renewable Energy;+2;The implementation of climate resilience targets may reinforce the development of renewable energy sources, as climate-resilient infrastructure can support the integration of renewable energy into the grid.;The use of climate-resilient design and materials in renewable energy infrastructure can reduce the risk of damage from extreme weather events and improve the overall resilience of the energy system.
