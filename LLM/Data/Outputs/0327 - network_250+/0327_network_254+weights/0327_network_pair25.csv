GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is closely linked to the increase in renewable energy production, as renewable energy sources are a key component of a low-carbon economy.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Energy Efficiency;+2;Improving energy efficiency is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the implementation of energy-efficient technologies can aid in the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Food affordability;+1;A competitive agricultural sector can contribute to food affordability by increasing the efficiency and productivity of food production, thereby reducing costs and making food more accessible to consumers.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.5,TA6.26,TA6.9,TA7.10,TA7.21;Food quality;+2;Reducing the use of pesticides can have a positive impact on food quality, as it can lead to a decrease in the amount of harmful chemicals present in food products.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Social Security - Energy;+1;Protecting workers' rights and ensuring fair income can contribute to social security in the energy sector, as energy workers are more likely to have stable and secure employment.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Food quality - Healthy Food;+1;Improving animal welfare can have a positive impact on food quality, as it can lead to better living conditions and treatment of animals, resulting in healthier and more nutritious food products.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Food quality;+1;Ensuring food affordability can contribute to food quality, as consumers who have access to affordable food are more likely to choose healthier and more nutritious options.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.5,TA6.26,TA6.9,TA7.10,TA7.21;Renewable Energy - Solar;+1;Reducing pesticide use can create opportunities for solar energy production, as land previously used for pesticide-intensive farming can be repurposed for solar panels.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-1;The focus on competitive agriculture may constrain the development of renewable energy sources like hydrogen production, as agricultural activities may compete with energy production for land and resources.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Food affordability;-1;Promoting healthy food options can increase food costs, making it less affordable for some consumers, which may negatively impact food affordability.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Energy Efficiency;-1;Protecting workers' rights in the energy sector may constrain the implementation of energy-efficient technologies, as the focus on social security may lead to increased costs and reduced investment in energy efficiency measures.
