Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.13,TA2.14,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.4,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.14,TA4.20,TA4.21,TA5.10,TA5.13;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in waste generated from fossil fuel-based energy production, which in turn can reduce municipal waste. This is because renewable energy sources like solar and wind power produce little to no waste.
Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.13,TA2.14,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.4,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.14,TA4.20,TA4.21,TA5.10,TA5.13;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;2;The integration of renewable energy with circular economy practices can enhance waste reduction and recycling efforts in municipalities. For instance, renewable energy can power recycling facilities and support the development of closed-loop production systems.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.3,TA2.40;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;-;2;The production of renewable hydrogen can be energy-intensive and may require significant amounts of electricity, which could strain the energy grid and impact the development of net-zero technologies. However, with the advancement of renewable energy technologies, this constraint can be mitigated.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+;1;The growth of the solar industry can drive demand for recycled materials, such as silicon, which is used in solar panel production. This can create new opportunities for plastic and packaging recycling, enabling a more circular economy.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36,TA7.8;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;1;Improving energy efficiency in the food sector can lead to reduced food waste by optimizing production, processing, and distribution. This, in turn, can decrease the amount of waste generated during these processes.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.18,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;2;Energy-efficient buildings can reduce the demand for energy storage solutions like batteries, thereby decreasing the need for critical raw materials used in battery production. Additionally, recycling batteries from energy-efficient buildings can provide a valuable source of these materials.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;-;1;Increased energy security and access to energy can lead to higher consumption levels, potentially resulting in more plastic and packaging waste. However, this can be mitigated through the implementation of circular economy practices and waste reduction strategies.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;2;The development of offshore renewable energy technologies can increase demand for critical raw materials like steel, copper, and rare earth metals, which may lead to increased extraction and import activities. This could have environmental and social implications associated with mining and material processing.
