Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The implementation of waste reduction targets in municipal waste can reinforce the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles by promoting the use of recycled materials and reducing waste sent to landfills, which can aid in the production of electric vehicles.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;Biofuels;+1;Reducing food waste can enable the production of biofuels by creating conditions for the use of organic waste as a feedstock, which can contribute to the development of low-carbon fuels.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Urban Mobility;+1;Improving recycling rates in municipal waste can enable the development of urban mobility solutions by promoting the use of recycled materials in the production of electric vehicles and other transportation modes.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+2;The development of critical raw materials can reinforce the manufacturing of net-zero technologies by providing the necessary materials for the production of clean energy technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Transport Logistics;+1;The development of net-zero technologies in manufacturing can enable the creation of more efficient transportation systems by promoting the use of electric and autonomous vehicles, which can aid in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Hydrogen Distribution;-1;The recycling of critical raw materials in batteries can constrain the development of hydrogen distribution by limiting the availability of materials needed for the production of fuel cells and other hydrogen-related technologies.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37,TA3.39;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;-2;The reduction of plastic waste can counteract the development of other low-carbon fuels by limiting the availability of feedstocks needed for the production of these fuels, such as plastic waste-to-fuel technologies.
