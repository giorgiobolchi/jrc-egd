Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Renewable Energy - Solar;+2;The reduction of municipal waste can lead to an increased availability of land for solar panel installations, thereby reinforcing the growth of renewable energy sources.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+1;Proper waste management can enable the construction of more energy-efficient buildings, as materials can be recycled and reused, creating conditions that further energy efficiency targets.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-1;The focus on recycling and circularity in municipal waste management might constrain the development of hydrogen production, as resources and investments could be diverted to waste management, limiting options for hydrogen production.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Renewable Energy;+3;The extraction and import of critical raw materials are indivisible from the development and implementation of renewable energy technologies, as these materials are essential for the production of solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable energy infrastructure.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Energy Efficiency;-2;The development of net-zero technology manufacturing might counteract energy efficiency targets, as the production process could lead to increased energy consumption, potentially clashing with energy efficiency goals.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;+1;The recycling of critical raw materials from batteries can enable the development of more efficient and sustainable renewable energy technologies, such as offshore wind farms, creating conditions that further the growth of ocean/offshore renewable energy.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+2;Reducing plastic and packaging waste can reinforce energy efficiency in buildings, as it can lead to the development of more sustainable and energy-efficient packaging materials and construction practices.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;Renewable Energy - Solar;-1;The focus on recycling and circularity in textile waste management might constrain the development of solar energy, as resources and investments could be diverted to textile waste management, limiting options for solar energy production.
