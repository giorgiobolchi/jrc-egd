Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21,TA4.22;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn can help to restore terrestrial ecosystems by reducing the negative impacts of climate change on these ecosystems. This can create a reinforcing effect, where the restoration of ecosystems can further support the transition to renewable energy.
Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21,TA4.22;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;-1;The large-scale deployment of renewable energy infrastructure, such as wind farms and solar panels, can have negative impacts on biodiversity, including the destruction of habitats and the disruption of ecosystems. This can constrain the achievement of biodiversity protection targets.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.2,TA2.38,TA2.39;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+1;The production of renewable hydrogen can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes, which can in turn help to restore terrestrial ecosystems. This can create an enabling effect, where the use of renewable hydrogen can support the restoration of ecosystems.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.2,TA2.38,TA2.39;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;-2;The production of renewable hydrogen can require large amounts of energy and resources, which can have negative impacts on biodiversity, including the destruction of habitats and the disruption of ecosystems. This can counteract the achievement of biodiversity protection targets.
