Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;GHG Reduction;+2;The improvement of air quality can aid in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as cleaner air can lead to more efficient energy use and reduced pollution, which in turn can support the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14, TA7.15;GHG Reduction;+1;Better water quality can create conditions that support the reduction of GHG emissions, for example, by enabling more efficient water treatment processes that require less energy, thus indirectly contributing to GHG reduction.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Removal;+2;Improving soil health can aid in the removal of GHG from the atmosphere, as healthy soils can act as significant carbon sinks, supporting the achievement of GHG removal targets.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Climate Resilience;+1;Reducing noise pollution can create conditions that support climate resilience, for example, by protecting wildlife and ecosystems that play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change, thus enabling better adaptation to its impacts.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3,TA7.9;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+1;Improving sanitation can create conditions that support the reduction of GHG emissions in buildings, for example, by reducing the need for energy-intensive water treatment and promoting more efficient use of resources in residential and commercial buildings.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Reduction;+2;Improving soil health can aid in the reduction of GHG emissions, as healthy soils can support more efficient agricultural practices, reduce synthetic fertilizer use, and promote carbon sequestration, thus directly contributing to GHG reduction targets.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14, TA7.15;GHG Reduction - Transports;+1;Better water quality can create conditions that support the reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector, for example, by enabling more efficient transportation of goods and people through improved waterways, thus indirectly contributing to GHG reduction in transports.
Forest Bioeconomy;TA1.10,TA1.11,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+2;A sustainable forest bioeconomy can aid in the reduction of GHG emissions in buildings, for example, by providing renewable materials for construction and promoting the use of biomass energy, which can replace fossil fuels and support the achievement of GHG reduction targets in the building sector.
