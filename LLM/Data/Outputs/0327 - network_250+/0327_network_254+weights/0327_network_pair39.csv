GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions is crucial for the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles, as it enables the creation of cleaner and more efficient transportation systems. This synergy can aid in the achievement of both targets.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Urban Mobility;+1;Improving air quality can create conditions that further urban mobility, as cleaner air can enhance the overall quality of life in urban areas, making them more attractive for residents and visitors. This can lead to increased investment in sustainable urban planning and transportation.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.7,TA7.6;Hydrogen Distribution;+1;The improvement of water quality can enable the development of hydrogen distribution, as clean water is essential for the production and transportation of hydrogen. This connection can facilitate the growth of the hydrogen industry, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Biofuels;+2;The improvement of soil health can aid in the production of biofuels, as healthier soils can lead to more efficient and sustainable crop yields. This synergy can reinforce the development of biofuels as a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;-1;The reduction of noise pollution can constrain the development of certain transportation systems, such as those relying on internal combustion engines, which may be noisy. However, this constraint can also drive innovation towards quieter and more sustainable transportation solutions.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3,TA7.9;Transport Logistics;+1;The improvement of social security and sanitation can create conditions that further transport logistics, as cleaner and healthier environments can enhance the overall efficiency and safety of transportation systems. This connection can lead to increased investment in sustainable and sanitary transportation infrastructure.
