Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;GHG Reduction;+2;The reduction of municipal waste can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration are significant contributors to GHG emissions. Effective waste reduction strategies can reinforce GHG reduction efforts.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;GHG Reduction;+2;Reducing food waste can lower GHG emissions from agricultural production, transportation, and storage. This can reinforce GHG reduction targets by decreasing the demand for resource-intensive food production.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;GHG Reduction;+2;Improving recycling rates and reducing waste sent to landfills can decrease GHG emissions from waste management. This can aid in achieving GHG reduction targets by minimizing the environmental impact of waste disposal.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;GHG Reduction;+1;Responsible extraction and import of critical raw materials can enable the production of low-carbon technologies, such as renewable energy systems and energy storage. This can create conditions that further GHG reduction efforts.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;GHG Reduction;+3;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies are inextricably linked to achieving GHG reduction targets. These technologies are essential for reducing emissions in various sectors, making this connection indivisible.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;GHG Reduction;+2;Recycling critical raw materials from batteries can reduce the need for primary material extraction, which is often energy-intensive and contributes to GHG emissions. This can reinforce GHG reduction efforts by decreasing the carbon footprint of material production.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.30,TA3.40;GHG Removal;+1;Reducing plastic waste and promoting recycling can decrease GHG emissions from production and waste management. This can create conditions that further GHG removal efforts by minimizing the environmental impact of plastic pollution.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;GHG Reduction;+2;Improving circularity and recycling rates can reduce GHG emissions from production and consumption. This can aid in achieving GHG reduction targets by decreasing the demand for resource-intensive products and promoting sustainable consumption patterns.
