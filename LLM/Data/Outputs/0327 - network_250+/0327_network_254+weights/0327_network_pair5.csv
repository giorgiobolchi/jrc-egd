GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Air Quality;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can lead to improved air quality, as many GHG-emitting activities also release air pollutants, thus reinforcing the achievement of air quality targets.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Water Quality;+1;Reducing GHG emissions can create conditions that further improve water quality by decreasing the energy demand for water treatment and reducing pollution from energy production.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Improve Air Quality;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions from transport can directly improve air quality by reducing emissions of pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds.
GHG Removal;TA1.12,TA1.15;Improve Soils Health;+3;GHG removal strategies like afforestation/reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are indivisible from improving soil health, as these practices enhance soil organic matter, structure, and fertility.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.14,TA1.15;Improve Air Quality;+1;Energy-efficient buildings and renewable energy systems can reduce air pollution from heating and cooling, thus enabling the achievement of better air quality.
Climate Resilience;TA1.4,TA5.7;Improve Water Quality;+2;Enhancing climate resilience can aid in maintaining or improving water quality by protecting water sources from the impacts of climate change, such as increased frequency of floods and droughts.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Noise Reduction;-1;The implementation of GHG reduction measures might constrain options for noise reduction, as some renewable energy technologies (e.g., wind turbines) can generate noise pollution.
GHG Removal;TA1.12,TA1.15;Social Security - Sanitation;-2;Large-scale GHG removal efforts, particularly those involving land use changes (like afforestation), can counteract social security and sanitation goals if they lead to displacement of communities or competition for water resources.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Improve Soils Health;-1;The shift towards low-carbon transport can constrain soil health improvement efforts if, for example, biofuel production competes with food crops for land, potentially leading to soil degradation.
