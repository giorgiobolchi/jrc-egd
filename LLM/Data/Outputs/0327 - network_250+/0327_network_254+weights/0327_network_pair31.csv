Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Renewable Energy;-1;The increased use of renewable energy sources may lead to the destruction of natural habitats and ecosystems, potentially harming biodiversity.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Energy Efficiency;+2;Improving energy efficiency can reduce the demand for energy and decrease the pressure on natural resources, which can help protect biodiversity.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Renewable Energy;+1;Restoring forests can help sequester carbon dioxide, which can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and support the transition to renewable energy sources.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Energy Efficiency;-1;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems may require more energy-intensive practices, potentially increasing energy consumption and counteracting energy efficiency efforts.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;+3;The restoration of marine ecosystems is indivisible from the development of offshore renewable energy sources, as healthy ecosystems can support the installation and maintenance of offshore energy infrastructure.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+2;Urban nature conservation can help reduce the urban heat island effect, decreasing the need for air conditioning and heating, and improving energy efficiency in buildings.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Renewable Energy;-2;The protection of fisheries and marine ecosystems may counteract the development of offshore renewable energy sources, as the installation of energy infrastructure can harm marine life.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.3,TA6.8,TA6.43,TA6.62;Renewable Energy;+1;Restoring terrestrial ecosystems can help sequester carbon dioxide, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and support the transition to renewable energy sources.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Energy Efficiency;+1;Monitoring biodiversity can help identify areas where energy efficiency efforts can be targeted to minimize harm to ecosystems and support the protection of biodiversity.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-1;The restoration of rivers may require the removal of dams and other infrastructure, potentially limiting the production of hydroelectric power, which can be used to produce renewable hydrogen.
