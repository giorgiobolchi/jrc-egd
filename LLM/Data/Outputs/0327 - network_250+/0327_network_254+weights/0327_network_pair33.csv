Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;-1;The implementation of biodiversity protection targets may constrain the development and deployment of net-zero technology road vehicles, as the production of these vehicles may rely on critical raw materials that are also essential for biodiversity conservation.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Biofuels;-1;The promotion of biofuels as a low-carbon alternative may counteract biodiversity protection efforts, as the production of biofuels can lead to land-use changes and habitat destruction.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Rail;+2;The restoration of forests can reinforce the development of rail transportation, as forests can provide a source of sustainable biomass for energy production, which can be used to power rail systems.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+2;The restoration of marine ecosystems can aid the development of net-zero technology maritime transport, as healthy marine ecosystems can provide a source of sustainable energy and support the development of low-carbon shipping technologies.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Urban Mobility;+1;The protection and restoration of urban nature can enable the development of sustainable urban mobility systems, as green spaces can provide ecosystem services that support human health and well-being, and can also serve as corridors for wildlife migration.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Biofuels;+1;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can enable the production of sustainable biofuels, as restored ecosystems can provide a source of biomass for energy production.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;-2;The protection of fisheries and the development of net-zero technology maritime transport may counteract each other, as the production of low-carbon shipping technologies may rely on materials that are also essential for fisheries conservation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;Hydrogen Distribution;+2;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can reinforce the development of hydrogen distribution systems, as restored ecosystems can provide a source of sustainable energy and support the development of low-carbon technologies.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;-1;The implementation of biodiversity protection targets may constrain the development and deployment of other low-carbon fuels, as the production of these fuels may rely on critical raw materials that are also essential for biodiversity conservation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Transport Logistics;+1;The restoration of rivers can enable the development of sustainable transport logistics systems, as restored rivers can provide a source of energy and support the development of low-carbon transportation technologies.
