TA7.8;Improve soil quality by reducing nutrient losses use by 50%, by 2030;TA5.20;+;The implementation of TA7.8 is likely to have a positive impact on TA5.20, as reducing nutrient losses can lead to an increase in soil fertility, which can in turn support the development of sustainable agriculture practices, ultimately contributing to the goal of fostering the competitiveness of the EU supply sector.

TA7.9;Improve air quality to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution by 55% by 2030;TA5.25;+;The implementation of TA7.9 is likely to have a positive impact on TA5.25, as improving air quality can lead to a decrease in air pollution-related health problems, which can in turn support the development of sustainable agriculture and food systems, ultimately contributing to the goal of promoting better animal welfare to improve animal health and food quality.

TA7.10;Improve water quality by reducing waste, plastic litter at sea (by 50%);TA5.29;+;The implementation of TA7.10 is likely to have a positive impact on TA5.29, as improving water quality can lead to an increase in the availability of clean water for human consumption, which can in turn support the development of sustainable food systems, ultimately contributing to the goal of improving availability of sustainable food.

TA7.11;Improve water quality by reducing microplastics released into the environment (by 30%);TA5.29;+;The implementation of TA7.11 is likely to have a positive impact on TA5.29, as reducing microplastics can lead to an increase in water quality, which can in turn support the development of sustainable food systems, ultimately contributing to the goal of improving availability of sustainable food.

TA7.13;Reduce by 25% the EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity, by 2030;TA5.17;+;The implementation of TA7.13 is likely to have a positive impact on TA5.17, as reducing air pollution can lead to an increase in biodiversity, which can in turn support the development of sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, ultimately contributing to the goal of helping farmers and fishers to strengthen their position in the supply chain.

TA7.14;Reduce the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30%, by 2030;TA5.22;-;The implementation of TA7.14 is likely to have a negative impact on TA5.22, as reducing transport noise can lead to an increase in transportation costs, which can in turn make it more difficult to create shorter supply chains and reduce dependence on long-haul transportation.

TA7.15;Having all soils in healthy condition by 2050;TA5.14;+;The implementation of TA7.15 is likely to have a positive impact on TA5.14, as improving soil health can lead to an increase in soil fertility, which can in turn support the development of sustainable agriculture practices, ultimately contributing to the goal of scaling-up and promoting sustainable and socially responsible production methods and circular business models in food processing and retail.
