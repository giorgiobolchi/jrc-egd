TA1.3; Reduce by at least 55% net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, by 2030. Assessment: The at least 55% economy-wide net reduction objective is enshrined in the Climate Law as an overall ambition at the EU level.; TA1.9; The contribution of the sectors covered by the EU ETS with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62% compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2% per year up to 4.4%); +; The implementation of TA1.3 will have a positive impact on TA1.9 as reducing GHG emissions will contribute to the EU's climate ambition, and the increased linear emissions reduction factor will help achieve the -62% reduction target. The two targets are closely related and work together to reduce emissions and achieve the EU's climate goals.

TA1.9; The contribution of the sectors covered by the EU ETS with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62% compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2% per year up to 4.4%); TA1.3; Reduce by at least 55% net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, by 2030. Assessment: The at least 55% economy-wide net reduction objective is enshrined in the Climate Law as an overall ambition at the EU level.; +; The implementation of TA1.9 will have a positive impact on TA1.3 as the -62% reduction in emissions from sectors covered by the EU ETS will contribute to the overall goal of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels.

TA2.1; REPowerEU sets a target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production and 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen imports by 2030.; TA2.9; Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union’s gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 42.5%.; +; The implementation of TA2.1 will have a positive impact on TA2.9 as increasing renewable hydrogen production and imports will contribute to the overall share of energy from renewable sources in the EU's gross final consumption.

TA2.9; Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union’s gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 42.5%.; TA2.1; REPowerEU sets a target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production and 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen imports by 2030.; +; The implementation of TA2.9 will have a positive impact on TA2.1 as increasing the share of energy from renewable sources will create a demand for renewable hydrogen, driving the production and import targets.

TA3.1; Moving to an economic and legal framework that supports circularity for competitiveness; TA6.10; At least 10% of agricultural area is under high-diversity landscape features; +; The implementation of TA3.1 will have a positive impact on TA6.10 as a circular economy framework can promote sustainable agriculture practices, including the use of high-diversity landscape features, which can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services.

TA6.10; At least 10% of agricultural area is under high-diversity landscape features; TA3.1; Moving to an economic and legal framework that supports circularity for competitiveness; +; The implementation of TA6.10 will have a positive impact on TA3.1 as the use of high-diversity landscape features in agriculture can contribute to a circular economy by promoting sustainable land use, reducing waste, and enhancing ecosystem services.

TA5.32; Food security: Ensuring food security and access to quality, safe, sustainable, nutritious food for all.; TA6.7; By 2030, significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored.; +; The implementation of TA5.32 will have a positive impact on TA6.7 as ensuring food security and promoting sustainable agriculture practices can contribute to the restoration of degraded ecosystems, enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity.

TA6.7; By 2030, significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored.; TA5.32; Food security: Ensuring food security and access to quality, safe, sustainable, nutritious food for all.; +; The implementation of TA6.7 will have a positive impact on TA5.32 as restoring degraded ecosystems can enhance food security by promoting sustainable agriculture practices, improving soil health, and increasing biodiversity.
