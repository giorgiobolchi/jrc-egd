TA7.5; The revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive extends the scope of the 1991 UWWTD to improve and maintain access to sanitation for all; TA6.51; Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that water intended for human consumption is wholesome and clean; +; The implementation of the revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive could support the improvement of water quality, as it promotes the treatment of wastewater and the reduction of pollutants in water bodies.
TA7.6; Improve soil quality by reducing chemical pesticides’ use by 50% by 2030; TA5.4; Reduce by 50% the use of more hazardous pesticides; +; The reduction of chemical pesticides' use could support the reduction of more hazardous pesticides, as it promotes more sustainable agricultural practices and reduces the environmental impact of pesticide use.
TA7.8; Improve soil quality by reducing nutrient losses use by 50% by 2030; TA5.3; Reduce nutrient losses by at least 50%, while ensuring that there is no deterioration in soil fertility; +; The reduction of nutrient losses could support the reduction of nutrient losses in soil, as it promotes more efficient use of nutrients and reduces the environmental impact of nutrient pollution.
TA7.9; Improve air quality to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution by 55% by 2030; TA6.52; The Ambient Air Quality Directives set EU air quality standards for 12 air pollutants; +; The improvement of air quality could support the reduction of premature deaths caused by air pollution, as it promotes the reduction of air pollutants and improves public health.
TA7.10; Improve water quality by reducing waste, plastic litter at sea (by 50%); TA5.8; Water: Preserving freshwater, boosting water reuse in agriculture; +; The reduction of waste and plastic litter at sea could support the preservation of freshwater and the boosting of water reuse in agriculture, as it reduces the amount of pollutants in water bodies and promotes more sustainable water management practices.
TA7.11; Improve water quality by reducing microplastics released into the environment (by 30%); TA6.51; Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that water intended for human consumption is wholesome and clean; +; The reduction of microplastics could support the improvement of water quality, as it reduces the amount of microplastics in water bodies and promotes more sustainable water management practices.
TA7.13; Reduce by 25% the EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity, by 2030; TA6.48; Member States shall achieve an increasing trend at national level of at least six out of seven of the following indicators in forest ecosystems; +; The reduction of air pollution could support the improvement of forest ecosystems, as it reduces the impact of air pollutants on forest health and biodiversity.
TA7.14; Reduce the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30%, by 2030; TA4.28; By 31 December 2030, in each safe and secure parking area at least four publicly accessible recharging stations dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles; -; The reduction of transport noise could have a negative impact on the deployment of recharging stations, as it may lead to increased restrictions on the location of recharging stations in noise-sensitive areas.
TA7.15; Having all soils in healthy condition by 2050; TA7.6; Improve soil quality by reducing chemical pesticides’ use by 50% by 2030; +; The improvement of soil health could support the reduction of chemical pesticides' use, as healthier soils can support more diverse and resilient ecosystems and reduce the need for pesticides.
TA7.16; By means of an updated and harmonised list of pollutants affecting surface and groundwater; TA6.51; Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that water intended for human consumption is wholesome and clean; +; The update of the list of pollutants could support the improvement of water quality, as it promotes the identification and reduction of pollutants in water bodies.
