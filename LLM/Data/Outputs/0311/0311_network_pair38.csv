TA3.51;The contribution of waste management operators to recycling of plastics;TA2.38;+;The implementation of TA3.51 is likely to have a positive impact on TA2.38, as the increased recycling of plastics can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the EU's offshore renewable energy goals.
TA3.51;The contribution of waste management operators to recycling of plastics;TA2.39;-;However, the focus on recycling plastics might divert attention and resources away from other critical raw materials, potentially hindering the achievement of TA2.39, which aims to increase the use of ocean energy.
TA4.3;The yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship;TA2.38;+;The reduction in GHG emissions from shipping, as targeted by TA4.3, can contribute to the overall decrease in emissions, supporting the achievement of TA2.38.
TA4.3;The yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship;TA4.8;-;On the other hand, the implementation of TA4.3 might lead to increased costs for the shipping industry, potentially making it more challenging to achieve TA4.8, which aims to increase the use of renewable fuels in maritime transport.
TA4.9;Cut the emissions of transport sector by 90% by 2050;TA4.10;+;The ambitious target of TA4.9 can drive innovation and investment in sustainable transportation, supporting the achievement of TA4.10, which aims to reduce the energy intensity of the EU fisheries sector.
TA4.10;The EU fisheries are encouraged to continue the positive trend towards reducing fuel intensity;TA4.9;+;The reduction in fuel intensity, as targeted by TA4.10, can contribute to the overall decrease in emissions from the transport sector, supporting the achievement of TA4.9.
TA4.13;For urban buses, manufacturers shall comply with minimum shares in their fleet of new heavy-duty vehicles;TA4.15;+;The increased adoption of zero-emission urban buses, as targeted by TA4.13, can drive demand for renewable energy and support the achievement of TA4.15, which aims to reduce the carbon intensity of the EU's vehicle fleet.
TA4.15;The average CO2 emissions of the Union fleet of new heavy-duty motor vehicles shall be reduced;TA4.13;+;The reduction in CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, as targeted by TA4.15, can support the achievement of TA4.13, which aims to increase the adoption of zero-emission urban buses.
TA4.18;The share of biofuels and biogas produced from feedstock listed in Part B of Annex IX shall be limited;TA4.20;-;The limitation on biofuels and biogas, as targeted by TA4.18, might hinder the achievement of TA4.20, which aims to increase the production of renewable hydrogen.
TA4.20;In the first phase, from 2020 up to 2024, the strategic objective is to install at least 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers;TA4.18;-;The focus on renewable hydrogen, as targeted by TA4.20, might lead to increased demand for biofuels and biogas, potentially conflicting with the limitations set by TA4.18.
TA4.25;Member States shall ensure that publicly accessible recharging stations provide a total power output;TA4.26;+;The increased deployment of recharging infrastructure, as targeted by TA4.25, can support the achievement of TA4.26, which aims to increase the number of charging points along the TEN-T core network.
TA4.26;Member States shall ensure that along the TEN-T core and comprehensive network, publicly accessible recharging pools are deployed;TA4.25;+;The deployment of recharging pools, as targeted by TA4.26, can support the achievement of TA4.25, which aims to increase the power output of recharging stations.
