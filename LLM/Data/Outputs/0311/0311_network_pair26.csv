TA3.16;Producers of portable batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall attain, and maintain durably, at least the following collection targets for waste portable batteries;TA3.17;+;The implementation of TA3.16 is likely to have a positive impact on TA3.17, as the collection targets for portable batteries can contribute to the goal of collecting waste LMT batteries, by promoting the proper disposal and recycling of batteries.
TA3.17;Producers of LMT batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall attain, and maintain durably, at least the following collection targets of waste LMT batteries;TA3.18;+;The implementation of TA3.17 is likely to have a positive impact on TA3.18, as the collection targets for LMT batteries can contribute to the goal of increasing the recycled content of batteries, by providing a stable supply of recycled materials for use in battery production.
TA3.18;For industrial batteries with a capacity greater than 2kWh, except those with exclusively external storage, electric vehicle batteries and starting, lighting and ignition batteries that contain cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel in active materials, the minimum recycled content percentage for each battery model per year and per manufacturing plant shall be;TA3.20;+;The implementation of TA3.18 is likely to have a positive impact on TA3.20, as the minimum recycled content requirement for batteries can contribute to the goal of achieving recycling efficiency targets, by promoting the use of recycled materials in battery production.
TA3.20;Recycling shall achieve at least the following targets for recycling efficiency;TA7.13;-;The implementation of TA3.20 may have a negative impact on TA7.13, as the focus on recycling efficiency may divert attention and resources away from the goal of reducing the EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity, by prioritizing the recycling of materials over the protection of ecosystems.
TA6.47;When identifying and implementing the restoration measures to meet the objectives and obligations set out in Articles 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, Member States shall aim to contribute to the commitment of planting at least three billion additional trees by 2030 at Union level;TA2.38;+;The implementation of TA6.47 is likely to have a positive impact on TA2.38, as the goal of planting additional trees can contribute to the goal of increasing the use of offshore wind energy, by reducing the pressure on land use for energy production and allowing for more space for offshore wind farms.
