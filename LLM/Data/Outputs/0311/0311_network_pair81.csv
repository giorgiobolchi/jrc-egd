TA2.1; REPowerEU sets a target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production and 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen imports by 2030; TA7.4; The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) aims at preventing or reducing emissions from large industrial installations and intensive farming into the environment; +; The production of renewable hydrogen will reduce emissions from industrial installations, thus supporting the achievement of the IED targets.
TA2.5; Bring online over 320 GW of solar photovoltaic by 2025 and almost 600 GW by 2030; TA7.9; Improve air quality to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution by 55% by 2030; +; The increased deployment of solar photovoltaic will reduce air pollution, thus supporting the achievement of the 55% reduction target in premature deaths caused by air pollution.
TA3.1; The revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) extends the scope of the 1991 UWWTD to improve and maintain access to sanitation for all; TA6.51; Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that water intended for human consumption is wholesome and clean; +; The improved wastewater treatment will reduce the amount of pollutants in water bodies, thus supporting the achievement of the target of providing wholesome and clean water for human consumption.
TA4.1; Achieve an annual production of sustainable biomethane of 35 billion cubic meters by 2030; TA7.8; Improve soil quality by reducing chemical pesticides’ use by 50%, by 2030; +; The production of sustainable biomethane will reduce the use of chemical pesticides, thus supporting the achievement of the 50% reduction target.
TA6.47; When identifying and implementing the restoration measures to meet the objectives and obligations set out in Articles 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, Member States shall aim to contribute to the commitment of planting at least three billion additional trees by 2030 at Union level; TA7.13; Reduce by 25% the EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity, by 2030; +; The restoration of ecosystems through tree planting will reduce air pollution, thus supporting the achievement of the 25% reduction target in EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity.
TA6.48; Member States shall achieve an increasing trend at national level of at least six out of seven of the following indicators in forest ecosystems; TA7.14; Reduce the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30%, by 2030; +; The improvement of forest ecosystems will reduce the amount of noise pollution, thus supporting the achievement of the 30% reduction target in people chronically disturbed by transport noise.
TA6.50; Reach no net land take; TA7.15; Having all soils in healthy condition by 2050; +; The achievement of no net land take will support the improvement of soil health, thus contributing to the target of having all soils in healthy condition by 2050.
TA7.4; The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) aims at preventing or reducing emissions from large industrial installations and intensive farming into the environment; TA1.3; Reduce by at least 55% net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, by 2030; +; The reduction of emissions from industrial installations will contribute to the achievement of the 55% reduction target in GHG emissions.
TA7.9; Improve air quality to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution by 55% by 2030; TA2.5; Bring online over 320 GW of solar photovoltaic by 2025 and almost 600 GW by 2030; +; The improvement of air quality will support the increased deployment of solar photovoltaic, as air pollution can reduce the efficiency of solar panels.
TA7.11; Improve water quality by reducing microplastics released into the environment (by 30%); TA3.1; The revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) extends the scope of the 1991 UWWTD to improve and maintain access to sanitation for all; +; The reduction of microplastics in water bodies will support the improved wastewater treatment, thus contributing to the achievement of the UWWTD targets.
