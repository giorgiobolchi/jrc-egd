TA2.4;Double the current deployment rate of individual heat pumps, resulting in a cumulative 10 million units by 2027 and 30 million units by 2030.;TA6.35;+;The increased deployment of heat pumps will have a positive impact on the preservation and restoration of ecosystems, as it will help to reduce GHG emissions and pollution from heating systems.
TA2.5;Bring online over 320 GW of solar photovoltaic by 2025 and almost 600 GW by 2030.;TA6.41;+;The increased deployment of solar photovoltaic will have a positive impact on the preservation and restoration of marine ecosystems, as it will help to reduce pollution and its effects on marine biodiversity.
TA2.9;Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Unionâ€™s gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 42.5%.;TA6.29;+;The increased share of renewable energy will have a positive impact on the preservation and restoration of ecosystems, as it will help to reduce GHG emissions and pollution from energy production.
TA4.1;Achieve an annual production of sustainable biomethane of 35 billion cubic meters by 2030.;TA6.44;+;The production of sustainable biomethane will have a positive impact on the preservation and restoration of agricultural ecosystems, as it will help to reduce GHG emissions and pollution from agriculture.
TA6.29;Terrestrial ecosystems. Member States shall put in place [...] measures [...] to jointly cover, as a Union target, throughout the areas and ecosystems [...] defined in Art. 2, by 2030, at least 20% of land areas in need of restoration and, by 2050, all ecosystems in need of restoration.;TA1.1;+;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems will have a positive impact on the reduction of GHG emissions, as it will help to sequester carbon dioxide and reduce the effects of climate change.
TA6.30;Marine ecosystems. Member States shall put in place [...] measures [...] to jointly cover, as a Union target, throughout the areas and ecosystems [...] defined in Art. 2, by 2030, at least 20% of sea areas in need of restoration and, by 2050, all ecosystems in need of restoration.;TA1.3;+;The restoration of marine ecosystems will have a positive impact on the reduction of GHG emissions, as it will help to reduce ocean acidification and its effects on marine biodiversity.
TA6.33;Terrestrial, coastal and freshwater ecosystems. Member States shall put in place the restoration measures [...] to improve to good condition areas of habitat types listed in Annex I which are not in good condition.;TA1.7;+;The restoration of terrestrial, coastal, and freshwater ecosystems will have a positive impact on the reduction of methane emissions, as it will help to reduce the effects of climate change on ecosystems and biodiversity.
TA6.41;Marine ecosystems. Member States shall put in place the restoration measures [...] to improve [...] areas of habitat types listed in Annex II which are not in good condition.;TA1.9;+;The restoration of marine ecosystems will have a positive impact on the reduction of GHG emissions from the EU ETS sectors, as it will help to reduce pollution and its effects on marine biodiversity.
TA6.42;Ecosystems. Member States shall put in place the restoration measures that are necessary to re-establish the habitat types of groups 1-6 listed in Annex II in areas not covered by those habitat types with the aim to reach their favourable reference area.;TA1.10;+;The restoration of ecosystems will have a positive impact on the reduction of GHG emissions from the buildings and road transport sectors, as it will help to reduce pollution and its effects on biodiversity.
