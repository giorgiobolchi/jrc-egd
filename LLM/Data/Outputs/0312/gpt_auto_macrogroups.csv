TA6_Preserving and protecting biodiversity;Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.32;(chapter I - art. 2: subject matter) Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures with the aim to jointly cover, as a Union target, throughout the areas and ecosystems within the scope as defined in Article 2, by 2030, at least 20 % of land areas in need of restoration and, by 2050, all ecosystems in need of restoration;This target focuses on restoring ecosystems in need of restoration.
TA6_Preserving and protecting biodiversity;Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.33;(chapter I - art. 2: subject matter) Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures with the aim to jointly cover, as a Union target, throughout the areas and ecosystems within the scope as defined in Article 2, by 2030, at least 20 % of sea areas in need of restoration and, by 2050, all ecosystems in need of restoration;This target emphasizes restoring sea areas in need of restoration.
TA6_Preserving and protecting biodiversity;Habitat Restoration;TA6.34;(terrestrial, coastal and freshwater ecosystems) Member States shall put in place the restoration measures that are necessary to improve to good condition areas of habitat types listed in Annex I which are not in good condition. Such measures shall be in place: (a) on at least 30 % by 2030 of the total area of all habitat types listed in Annex I that is not in good condition, as quantified in the national restoration plan referred to in Article 12, (b) on at least 60 % by 2040 and on at least 90 % by 2050 of the area of each group of habitat types listed in Annex I that is not in good condition, as quantified in the national restoration plan referred to in Article 12.;This target focuses on restoring habitats to good condition.
