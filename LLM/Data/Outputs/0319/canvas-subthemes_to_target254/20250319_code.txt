            Data input & Context:
            - List of thematic areas (TA): {thematic_areas}
            - List of European Green Deal (EGD) targets: {target_list}.
            - List of sub-themes: {canvas_sub_themes}.

            Task: 
            - For each target, assign a sub-theme from the list based on the target content.

            Answer format: provide your answer as a table in csv format (separator: ";"), with the following columns:
            - target_code (e.g., TA2.7)
            - target_content (e.g., Over this decade, the EU will need to install, on average, approximately 45 GW per year of PV to reach the share of 45% of energy coming from renewables set out in the REPowerEU Plan.) 
            - thematic_area (e.g., TA2_Clean, affordable and secure energy)
            - sub_theme (e.g., Renewable Energy - Solar)
            - justification

            Specifications:
            - This is crucial: all targets should be assigned to at least one sub-theme.
            - If one target is fitting in multiple sub-themes, add multiple rows for one same target.
            - If you cannot classify one target to any sub-theme, assign it to a sub-theme called 'Unclassified'. 
            - For each target, write 1-2 sentences to justify why a particular target was assigned to a specific sub-theme.
            - Output only the CSV table. Do not include additional commentary.
