Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in waste generated from fossil fuel-based energy production, which in turn can reduce municipal waste.;The connection between renewable energy and waste reduction is based on the idea that a shift towards cleaner energy sources can decrease the amount of waste produced.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-2;The production of renewable hydrogen may require the extraction of critical raw materials, which can lead to environmental and social concerns, thus counteracting the goals of responsible extraction and import.;The demand for critical raw materials for hydrogen production can strain the supply chain and lead to conflicts over resource access.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;Improving energy efficiency in the food sector can lead to a reduction in food waste by optimizing production and storage processes.;Energy-efficient practices can enable the reduction of food waste by minimizing energy consumption during food production, processing, and distribution.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;Energy-efficient buildings can reduce waste generation through the use of recycled materials in construction and the design of buildings that facilitate recycling and waste reduction.;The implementation of energy-efficient building practices can reinforce circular economy principles by promoting the use of recycled materials and reducing waste.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;-1;Policies aimed at ensuring social security in the energy sector might inadvertently constrain efforts to reduce plastic and packaging waste if they prioritize affordability over sustainability.;Social security measures focused on energy affordability might limit the adoption of sustainable packaging solutions due to higher costs.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+3;The development and manufacturing of solar technologies are crucial for achieving net-zero emissions, as solar energy is a key component of renewable energy systems.;The growth of the solar industry is indivisible from the advancement of net-zero technology manufacturing, as solar panels are a primary source of renewable energy.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+1;The transition to renewable heating and cooling systems can enable the recycling of critical materials used in these systems, such as those found in batteries.;The shift towards renewable heating and cooling can create conditions that further the recycling of critical raw materials by designing systems with recyclability in mind.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12;Circularity/Recycling;+2;Improving energy efficiency can aid in the circular economy by reducing the demand for new resources, thus reinforcing recycling and waste reduction efforts.;Energy efficiency measures can support the circular economy by minimizing waste and the continuous demand for new materials.
