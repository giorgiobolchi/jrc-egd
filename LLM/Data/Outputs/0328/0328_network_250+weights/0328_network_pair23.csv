GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Air Quality;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can lead to improved air quality, as many GHG-emitting activities also release air pollutants. This connection is reinforcing, as cleaner energy and reduced emissions can enhance overall environmental quality.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18;Improve Water Quality;-1;The production of biofuels can strain water resources, particularly if feedstocks require significant irrigation. This connection is constraining, as the pursuit of biofuel targets may limit options for water conservation and efficient use.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29;Urban Mobility;+3;The development and deployment of net-zero road vehicles are indivisible from urban mobility strategies, as these vehicles can significantly reduce emissions in urban areas and enhance air quality. This connection is crucial for achieving both net-zero and urban mobility goals.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;Improve Air Quality;+2;Efficient transport logistics can reduce emissions from transportation, which in turn can improve air quality. This connection is reinforcing, as streamlined logistics and reduced fuel consumption contribute to cleaner air.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Improve Air Quality;+2;The distribution and use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier can reduce air pollutants from energy production and use, reinforcing efforts to improve air quality.
Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;TA4.33,TA4.34,TA4.45;Improve Water Quality;+1;The transition to net-zero maritime transport can enable the reduction of water pollutants from shipping, creating conditions that further improve water quality.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;Improve Soils Health;-1;The production of other low-carbon fuels, such as those from agricultural waste or biomass, can impact soil health through land use changes or intensive farming practices. This connection is constraining, as the expansion of these fuels may limit sustainable land use options.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;Improve Air Quality;+2;The promotion of rail transport can reduce the reliance on more polluting modes of transportation, such as trucks, thereby improving air quality. This connection is reinforcing, as increased rail usage can lower emissions and enhance environmental quality.
Net-Zero Technology - Aviation;TA4.32,TA4.46;Improve Air Quality;+2;The development of net-zero technologies for aviation, such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft, can significantly reduce emissions from air travel, reinforcing efforts to improve air quality.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54,TA4.55;Improve Air Quality;+3;Urban mobility strategies that prioritize clean transportation, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and reduced vehicle emissions are indivisible from improved air quality, as they directly address sources of urban air pollution.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;Noise Reduction;+1;Efficient logistics and transportation planning can reduce noise pollution by minimizing unnecessary vehicle movements and promoting quieter transportation modes, creating conditions that further reduce noise.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18;Noise Reduction;-1;The production and distribution of biofuels can generate noise pollution, particularly during the harvesting and processing of feedstocks. This connection is constraining, as the expansion of biofuel production may limit options for noise reduction.
