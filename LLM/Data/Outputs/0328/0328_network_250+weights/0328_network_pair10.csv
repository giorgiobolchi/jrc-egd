Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20, TA4.21;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+2;The increased use of renewable energy can aid in the restoration of agricultural ecosystems by reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and promoting more sustainable land use practices. This can lead to improved soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+1;The production of renewable hydrogen can contribute to biodiversity protection by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting cleaner energy sources. This can help mitigate climate change impacts on ecosystems and species.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;-1;Improved energy efficiency in buildings can lead to increased demand for wood products, potentially constraining forest restoration efforts. Sustainable forest management practices can help mitigate this impact.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+2;The development of solar energy can support marine ecosystem restoration by reducing the environmental impacts of traditional energy sources. This can help protect marine biodiversity and promote ecosystem health.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.41;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+1;Energy efficiency measures can contribute to urban nature conservation by reducing energy consumption and promoting sustainable urban planning. This can help protect urban ecosystems and biodiversity.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+1;Social security measures related to energy can support river restoration by promoting sustainable water management practices and reducing the environmental impacts of energy production.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+3;Offshore renewable energy development can directly support marine ecosystem restoration by promoting sustainable ocean use and reducing the environmental impacts of traditional energy sources. This can help protect marine biodiversity and promote ecosystem health.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.4;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;-2;The increased use of renewable energy for heating and cooling can counteract fisheries conservation efforts by promoting the use of biomass and other organic materials that may compete with fish feed or habitat. Sustainable biomass sourcing and management practices can help mitigate this impact.
