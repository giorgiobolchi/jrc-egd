GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;GHG Reduction;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU will reinforce the efforts to reduce GHG emissions in other sectors, creating a positive feedback loop. This is because reducing emissions in one sector can create opportunities for emission reductions in other sectors.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;GHG Removal;+1;The implementation of GHG reduction targets can enable the achievement of GHG removal targets by creating conditions that favor the adoption of carbon removal technologies. For instance, reducing emissions from energy production can create opportunities for carbon capture and storage.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Food affordability;+1;Improving the competitiveness of the EU's agricultural sector can enable the achievement of food affordability targets by increasing the efficiency of food production and distribution. This can lead to lower food prices and improved access to nutritious food.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Food quality;+2;Reducing the use of pesticides in agriculture can reinforce the achievement of food quality targets by reducing the amount of harmful chemicals in food products. This can lead to improved public health and environmental protection.
Social Security - Workers Protection;TA4.53,TA5.16,TA5.17,TA5.18,TA5.24;Food affordability;+1;Improving the social security and protection of workers in the agricultural sector can enable the achievement of food affordability targets by ensuring that farmers and agricultural workers have a stable income and can produce food at a lower cost.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Food quality;+3;Improving animal welfare in agriculture is indivisible from achieving food quality targets, as animal welfare is closely linked to the quality and safety of food products. For example, reducing animal stress and improving living conditions can lead to improved meat quality and reduced antibiotic use.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Food quality - Healthy Food;+2;Improving food affordability can reinforce the achievement of healthy food targets by making nutritious food more accessible to low-income households. This can lead to improved public health and reduced health inequalities.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Food affordability;+1;Improving the healthiness of food products can enable the achievement of food affordability targets by reducing the economic burden of unhealthy diets and improving public health. This can lead to reduced healthcare costs and improved productivity.
