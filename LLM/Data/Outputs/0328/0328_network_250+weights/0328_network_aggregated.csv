379;Climate Resilience;TA1.4;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;2;Enhancing climate resilience can reinforce biodiversity monitoring efforts by supporting the development of early warning systems for climate-related threats to biodiversity, enabling more effective conservation and restoration actions.;;;;;;;
380;GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;1;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on fisheries and marine ecosystems, supporting the conservation of fish populations and the restoration of marine biodiversity, which is crucial for the livelihoods of communities dependent on fishing and related industries.;;;;;;;
381;GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Air Quality;2;The reduction of GHG emissions can lead to improved air quality by decreasing the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere, which in turn can aid in achieving better air quality.; ;;;;;;
382;GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Water Quality;1;Reducing GHG emissions can create conditions that further improve water quality by decreasing the amount of pollutants that enter water bodies, enabling better water management practices.; ;;;;;;
383;GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Improve Air Quality;2;The reduction of GHG emissions from transport can significantly improve air quality by reducing the amount of pollutants emitted by vehicles, which reinforces efforts to achieve better air quality.; ;;;;;;
384;GHG Removal;TA1.12,TA1.16;Improve Soils Health;3;GHG removal strategies, such as afforestation/reforestation and soil carbon sequestration, are inextricably linked to improving soil health, as these practices can enhance soil organic carbon and fertility.; ;;;;;;
385;Climate Resilience;TA1.4;Improve Water Quality;1;Enhancing climate resilience can create conditions that further improve water quality by promoting more efficient water use and management practices, which can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources.; ;;;;;;
386;GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Improve Air Quality;1;The reduction of GHG emissions from buildings can create conditions that further improve air quality by reducing the energy needed for heating and cooling, which can decrease the amount of air pollutants emitted.; ;;;;;;
387;GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Noise Reduction;-1;The implementation of GHG reduction measures might constrain options for noise reduction, as some renewable energy sources (e.g., wind turbines) can generate noise pollution, limiting the achievement of noise reduction targets.; ;;;;;;
388;GHG Removal;TA1.12,TA1.16;Social Security - Sanitation;-2;The focus on GHG removal might counteract efforts to improve social security and sanitation, as resources allocated to GHG removal strategies might divert attention and funding away from essential social services, including sanitation infrastructure.; ;;;;;;
389;GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Improve Soils Health;-1;The transition to low-emission transport can constrain options for improving soil health, as the production of biofuels (a potential low-emission alternative) can compete with food crops for land use, potentially leading to soil degradation.; ;;;;;;
390;Climate Resilience;TA1.4;Forest Bioeconomy;2;Enhancing climate resilience can reinforce the development of a forest bioeconomy by promoting sustainable forest management practices that aid in maintaining healthy forests, which can provide numerous ecosystem services and support biodiversity.;;;;;;;
