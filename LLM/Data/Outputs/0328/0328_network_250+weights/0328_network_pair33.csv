Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Transport Logistics;-2;The implementation of biodiversity protection and conservation targets may counteract the growth of transport logistics, as the preservation of natural habitats and ecosystems could limit the expansion of transportation infrastructure.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Urban Mobility;-2;Similarly, the conservation of biodiversity may clash with the development of urban mobility, as the protection of natural areas could restrict the construction of new transportation systems and infrastructure.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+1;The restoration of forests can enable the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles, as sustainable forest management can provide biomass for bioenergy and other low-carbon fuels.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Biofuels;+2;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can reinforce the production of biofuels, as sustainable agriculture practices can increase crop yields and improve soil health, leading to more efficient biofuel production.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.30,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+2;The restoration of marine ecosystems can reinforce the development of net-zero technology in maritime transport, as healthy oceans can support the growth of low-carbon shipping and the use of alternative fuels.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+1;The protection of biodiversity in fisheries can enable the development of net-zero technology in maritime transport, as sustainable fishing practices can reduce the environmental impact of shipping and promote the use of low-carbon fuels.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Urban Mobility;+1;The protection of urban nature can enable the development of sustainable urban mobility, as green spaces can support the growth of low-carbon transportation and reduce the environmental impact of urbanization.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Transport Logistics;-1;The restoration of rivers can constrain the growth of transport logistics, as the preservation of natural habitats and ecosystems could limit the expansion of transportation infrastructure and require more sustainable and environmentally-friendly transportation options.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.21,TA6.29,TA6.31,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can reinforce the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles, as sustainable land use and ecosystem management can support the growth of low-carbon fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Net-Zero Technology - Aviation;+1;The monitoring of biodiversity can enable the development of net-zero technology in aviation, as the conservation of natural habitats and ecosystems can support the growth of sustainable aviation fuels and reduce the environmental impact of air travel.
