Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21;GHG Reduction;+;2;The increased use of renewable energy sources can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, thereby reinforcing the achievement of GHG reduction targets. This is because renewable energy sources like solar and wind power do not emit greenhouse gases during operation.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40;GHG Reduction;+;2;Hydrogen production from renewable energy sources can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, including transportation and industry, which in turn supports the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.41,TA2.17, TA2.19;GHG Reduction;+;2;Improving energy efficiency in buildings and industries can lead to a decrease in energy consumption, which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions and supports the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20, TA2.21, TA2.24, TA2.25, TA2.26, TA2.27, TA2.28, TA2.29, TA2.30, TA2.31, TA2.33, TA2.34, TA2.35, TA2.36;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;3;Energy efficiency measures in buildings, such as renovation and insulation, can directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, which is indivisible from achieving GHG reduction targets in the buildings sector.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2, TA2.8;GHG Reduction;+;1;Social security measures that ensure access to affordable energy can enable the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources, which in turn can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5, TA2.6, TA2.7;GHG Reduction;+;2;The increased use of solar energy can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, thereby reinforcing the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38, TA2.39;GHG Reduction;+;2;The development of offshore renewable energy sources, such as wind and tidal power, can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector and support the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14, TA2.16, TA2.4;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;3;The use of renewable energy sources for heating and cooling, such as heat pumps and solar thermal systems, can directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, which is indivisible from achieving GHG reduction targets in the buildings sector.
