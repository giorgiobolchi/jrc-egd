GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can aid in the conservation of biodiversity by mitigating the effects of climate change on ecosystems, which in turn can help protect and restore natural habitats.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;Reducing GHG emissions can reinforce efforts to restore terrestrial ecosystems, as healthier ecosystems can sequester more carbon, creating a positive feedback loop that supports both climate change mitigation and ecosystem restoration.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+1;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can enable the use of renewable energy sources, such as biomass from sustainably managed forests, which can support forest restoration by promoting sustainable forest management practices.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+2;Enhancing carbon removal technologies and practices can aid in the restoration of marine ecosystems by reducing ocean acidification, which is caused by excessive CO2 absorption from the atmosphere, thereby supporting the health of marine life and ecosystems.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+1;Reducing GHG emissions in urban areas can create conditions that support urban biodiversity by improving air quality, reducing the urban heat island effect, and promoting green spaces, which can help conserve urban wildlife and support ecosystem services.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+1;Transitioning to low-carbon transportation can reduce emissions from agricultural production and transport, supporting more sustainable agricultural practices and potentially reducing the environmental impact of agriculture on ecosystems, which can aid in their restoration.
Climate Resilience;TA1.4;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;+2;Enhancing climate resilience can reinforce biodiversity monitoring efforts by supporting the development of early warning systems for climate-related threats to biodiversity, enabling more effective conservation and restoration actions.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+1;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on fisheries and marine ecosystems, supporting the conservation of fish populations and the restoration of marine biodiversity, which is crucial for the livelihoods of communities dependent on fishing and related industries.
