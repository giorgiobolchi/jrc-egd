GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;-1;The reduction of GHG emissions can lead to increased energy efficiency, which may result in reduced waste generation in municipal areas, but it can also lead to increased costs for waste management, potentially constraining waste reduction efforts. This can create a trade-off between GHG reduction and waste reduction goals.; 
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling;+2;GHG reduction targets can reinforce circularity and recycling efforts by promoting the use of renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and increasing energy efficiency, which can lead to a more circular economy. This can aid in the achievement of circularity and recycling targets.; 
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;-1;The reduction of GHG emissions in buildings can lead to increased use of materials and resources, potentially resulting in more waste generation, which can constrain municipal waste reduction efforts. This can create a trade-off between building-related GHG reduction and municipal waste reduction goals.; 
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Circularity/Recycling - Vehicle Circularity;+1;The reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector can enable the development of more circular and sustainable vehicle production and end-of-life management practices, creating conditions that further vehicle circularity targets. This can lead to increased recycling and reuse of vehicle materials, reducing waste and promoting a more circular economy.; 
GHG Removal;TA7.8;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-2;The removal of GHG emissions can counteract the extraction and import of critical raw materials, as some of these materials may be used in GHG removal technologies, potentially leading to conflicts between GHG removal and critical raw material extraction goals. This can create a trade-off between these two targets.; 
Climate Resilience;TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+3;Climate resilience targets are inextricably linked to the development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies, as these technologies are necessary for reducing GHG emissions and achieving climate resilience. The development of net-zero technologies can aid in the achievement of climate resilience targets, making them indivisible.; 
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;The reduction of GHG emissions can enable the reduction of food waste by promoting more efficient food production, processing, and distribution practices, creating conditions that further food waste reduction targets. This can lead to reduced GHG emissions from food waste and promote a more circular food system.; 
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions in buildings can reinforce circularity and recycling efforts in municipal waste management by promoting the use of recycled materials, reducing waste, and increasing energy efficiency. This can aid in the achievement of municipal waste circularity and recycling targets.; 
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;-1;The reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector can lead to increased use of alternative fuels and packaging materials, potentially resulting in more plastic and packaging waste, which can constrain waste reduction efforts in this area. This can create a trade-off between transport-related GHG reduction and plastic and packaging waste reduction goals.
