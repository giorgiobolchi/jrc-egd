Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The implementation of waste reduction targets in municipal waste can aid the development of new technologies and infrastructure for net-zero road vehicles, such as electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, by promoting a culture of sustainability and reducing waste.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;Biofuels;+1;Reducing food waste can create conditions for the production of biofuels, as food waste can be converted into energy sources, thereby supporting the development of alternative energy sources.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Transport Logistics;+1;Improving recycling rates in municipal waste can enable the development of more efficient transport logistics, as recycling can reduce the need for primary materials and lower emissions from transportation.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;-2;The extraction and import of critical raw materials can counteract the development of net-zero manufacturing technologies, as the production of these technologies often relies on critical raw materials with significant environmental and social impacts.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Hydrogen Distribution;+3;The development of net-zero manufacturing technologies is inextricably linked to the distribution of hydrogen, as hydrogen can be used as a clean energy source for manufacturing processes.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.13,TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The recycling of critical raw materials from batteries can aid the development of net-zero road vehicles, such as electric vehicles, by reducing the need for primary materials and lowering emissions.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.29,TA3.30;Urban Mobility;+1;Reducing plastic waste can create conditions for the development of more sustainable urban mobility systems, such as those using electric or hybrid vehicles, by promoting a culture of sustainability and reducing waste.
