Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;Food quality;+2;The reduction of waste, particularly food waste, can reinforce the achievement of food quality targets by ensuring that food products are handled, stored, and distributed efficiently, thereby reducing the risk of contamination and spoilage.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+1;Proper waste management in municipal areas can enable better living conditions for animals, which in turn can improve animal welfare, thereby creating conditions that further the achievement of food quality targets related to animal products.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46,TA5.13;Food affordability;+2;Reducing food waste can reinforce the achievement of food affordability targets by ensuring that food products are available and accessible to all, thereby reducing food prices and improving food security.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Pesticides Reduction;-1;The reduction of plastic waste can constrain the use of pesticides in agriculture, as some pesticides are packaged in plastic materials, thereby limiting options for pesticide application and potentially affecting crop yields.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;Competitive Agriculture;+2;The promotion of circularity and recycling can reinforce the achievement of competitive agriculture targets by reducing waste, improving resource efficiency, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, which can lead to increased crop yields and improved agricultural productivity.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Food quality - Healthy Food;+1;The recycling of municipal waste can enable the recovery of nutrients and organic matter, which can be used as fertilizers or soil conditioners, thereby improving soil health and enabling the production of healthier food products.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;Social Security - Workers Protection;+1;The recycling of textile waste can enable the creation of new job opportunities in the textile recycling sector, which can contribute to social security and workers' protection by providing employment and income opportunities for workers in this sector.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Food affordability;-2;The extraction and import of critical raw materials can counteract the achievement of food affordability targets, as the production and trade of these materials can lead to environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social conflicts, which can increase food prices and reduce food availability.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Competitive Agriculture;+2;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies can reinforce the achievement of competitive agriculture targets by promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving resource efficiency, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which can lead to increased crop yields and improved agricultural productivity.
