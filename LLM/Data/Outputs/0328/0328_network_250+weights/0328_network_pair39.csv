GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions is closely linked to the development of net-zero technologies, including road vehicles, as it enables the transition to cleaner transportation modes. This synergy can aid in achieving both GHG reduction and net-zero technology targets.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Urban Mobility;+1;Improving air quality can create conditions that further urban mobility by making cities more livable and reducing the negative impacts of air pollution on public health, thus enabling more sustainable urban planning and transportation systems.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.22,TA7.1,TA7.7,TA7.11,TA7.14,TA7.15;Transport Logistics;+1;Enhancing water quality can enable more efficient and sustainable transport logistics, particularly for inland waterways, by reducing the environmental impacts of transportation and promoting the use of cleaner modes of transport.
Improve Soils Health;TA2.41,TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA7.10,TA7.12;Biofuels;+2;Improving soil health can reinforce the development of sustainable biofuels by ensuring that biomass production for energy does not degrade soil quality, thus supporting both soil health and the transition to renewable energy sources.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;-1;Net-Zero Technology - Aviation;Noise reduction efforts might constrain the development and implementation of net-zero aviation technologies if these technologies produce significant noise, potentially limiting options for their deployment and requiring additional noise reduction measures.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3,TA7.9;Hydrogen Distribution;-2;Ensuring social security and sanitation might counteract the widespread adoption of hydrogen distribution if the production and transportation of hydrogen are not managed to prevent leaks and ensure safety, potentially clashing with sanitation and social security goals.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.22,TA7.1,TA7.7,TA7.11,TA7.14,TA7.15;Rail;+1;Improving water quality can enable more sustainable rail transportation by reducing the environmental impacts of rail infrastructure and promoting the use of cleaner modes of transport, thus supporting both water quality and rail development.
Improve Soils Health;TA2.41,TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA7.10,TA7.12;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+2;Improving soil health can reinforce the development of other low-carbon fuels by ensuring that the production of these fuels does not harm soil quality, thus supporting both soil health and the transition to low-carbon energy sources.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Maritime Transport;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions is closely linked to the development of net-zero technologies, including maritime transport, as it enables the transition to cleaner transportation modes. This synergy can aid in achieving both GHG reduction and net-zero technology targets.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Net-Zero Technology - Aviation;+1;Improving air quality can create conditions that further the development of net-zero aviation technologies by making the need for cleaner air travel more pressing and promoting the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels and technologies.
