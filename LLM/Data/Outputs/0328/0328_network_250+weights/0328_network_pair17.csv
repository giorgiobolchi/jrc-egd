Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA7.18;Improve Air Quality;+2;The reduction of municipal waste can lead to a decrease in air pollution, as waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration release harmful pollutants into the air, and proper waste reduction and recycling can mitigate these effects.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA7.18;Improve Water Quality;+2;Municipal waste reduction can also improve water quality by reducing the amount of waste that ends up in waterways and oceans, thereby decreasing pollution and protecting aquatic ecosystems.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Improve Soils Health;+1;Recycling and proper waste management in municipal waste can lead to the recovery of nutrients and organic matter that can be used to improve soil health and fertility.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Improve Air Quality;-1;The extraction and processing of critical raw materials can lead to air pollution, as these activities often involve energy-intensive processes and release harmful emissions, which can negatively impact air quality.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Improve Water Quality;+1;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies, such as renewable energy systems and energy-efficient appliances, can lead to improved water quality by reducing the amount of pollution and waste generated during the production process.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.13,TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Improve Soils Health;+2;The recycling of critical raw materials, such as those used in batteries, can lead to the recovery of valuable materials and reduce the need for primary extraction, which can help to improve soil health by reducing the environmental impacts of mining and processing.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Improve Water Quality;+2;The reduction of plastic waste and improved packaging practices can lead to improved water quality by reducing the amount of plastic pollution in waterways and oceans.
Circularity/Recycling - Vehicle Circularity;TA3.38,TA3.48,TA3.49,TA3.50,TA3.51;Improve Air Quality;+1;The recycling and proper management of vehicle materials can lead to improved air quality by reducing the amount of waste and pollution generated during the production and disposal of vehicles.
