Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;GHG Reduction;+2;The improvement of air quality can aid in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as cleaner air can lead to more efficient energy use and reduced pollution from industrial activities.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.11,TA7.14,TA7.15;GHG Reduction;+1;Better water quality can create conditions for more efficient water management, which in turn can support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing water treatment processes and reducing energy consumption.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Reduction;+2;Healthy soils can aid in carbon sequestration, thus reinforcing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and can also support more efficient agricultural practices, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;GHG Reduction - Transports;+1;Reducing noise pollution from transportation can create conditions for more efficient and quieter transportation systems, which may encourage the use of cleaner transport modes, thus supporting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3,TA7.9;GHG Removal;+1;Improved sanitation can lead to better waste management, which can in turn support the removal of greenhouse gases through more efficient waste treatment and recycling processes, potentially utilizing waste as a resource for energy production.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.11,TA7.14,TA7.15;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+1;Cleaner water can support more efficient building operations, including heating and cooling systems, which can lead to reduced energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions from buildings.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Reduction - Transports;-1;While healthy soils are crucial for carbon sequestration and agricultural efficiency, the focus on soil health might constrain options for biofuel production, which could be seen as a transport fuel alternative, potentially limiting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector.
Forest Bioeconomy;TA2.41,TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA4.19,TA4.47,TA7.8;Climate Resilience;+2;A sustainable forest bioeconomy can reinforce climate resilience by promoting the use of renewable resources, supporting carbon sequestration, and encouraging sustainable land use practices that help mitigate the effects of climate change.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+2;Cleaner air can lead to more efficient energy use in buildings, reducing the need for heating and cooling, which in turn can lower greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, reinforcing the goal of reducing emissions in this sector.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Reduction;+3;Healthy soils are indivisible from the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as they play a critical role in carbon sequestration, and their health is directly linked to the efficiency of agricultural practices and the reduction of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which are significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
