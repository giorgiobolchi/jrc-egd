Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3, TA6.43, TA6.5, TA6.58, TA6.62, TA6.8;Improve Water Quality;+2;Reinforcing;The protection of biodiversity, especially in aquatic ecosystems, can aid in improving water quality by preserving natural habitats that help filter and clean water, thus reinforcing the targets of improving water quality.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3, TA6.43, TA6.5, TA6.58, TA6.62, TA6.8;Improve Soils Health;+2;Reinforcing;Conservation of biodiversity can also contribute to improving soil health, as certain species play a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling, which in turn can reinforce efforts to enhance soil quality.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Improve Air Quality;+1;Enabling;Urban biodiversity conservation can enable improvements in air quality by maintaining urban green spaces that absorb pollutants and produce oxygen, thus creating conditions that further air quality targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Forest Bioeconomy;+3;Indivisible;The restoration of forests is inextricably linked to the development of a sustainable forest bioeconomy, as healthy forests are essential for providing the raw materials needed for forest products and ecosystem services that support bioeconomic activities.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.30,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Improve Water Quality;+2;Reinforcing;Restoring marine ecosystems can help improve water quality by enhancing the natural processes that filter and clean water, such as those performed by wetlands and coral reefs, thus reinforcing water quality improvement targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Improve Water Quality;+1;Enabling;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices, which are crucial for biodiversity conservation in fisheries, can also enable improvements in water quality by reducing pollution from fishing gear and aquaculture operations.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Improve Soils Health;+3;Indivisible;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems is directly linked to improving soil health, as sustainable agricultural practices like organic farming and agroforestry can enhance soil fertility, structure, and biodiversity, which are essential for soil health.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3, TA6.43, TA6.5, TA6.58, TA6.62, TA6.8;Noise Reduction;+1;Enabling;Conservation efforts, especially in urban and natural areas, can enable reductions in noise pollution by preserving or restoring natural sound barriers and promoting quieter environments, thus creating conditions that further noise reduction targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Improve Water Quality;+2;Reinforcing;Restoring rivers and their ecosystems can aid in improving water quality by maintaining natural river flows, reducing pollution, and enhancing aquatic habitats, which in turn can reinforce efforts to improve water quality.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Improve Air Quality;+1;Enabling;Effective monitoring of biodiversity can enable improvements in air quality by identifying areas where conservation efforts can also contribute to reducing air pollution, thus creating conditions that further air quality targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3, TA6.43, TA6.5, TA6.58, TA6.62, TA6.8;Social Security - Sanitation;+1;Enabling;Conservation of biodiversity, particularly in wetlands and other ecosystems that filter water, can enable improvements in sanitation by ensuring access to clean water, which is essential for human health and hygiene, thus creating conditions that further sanitation targets.
