Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;GHG Reduction;+2;Reinforcing;The protection of biodiversity can aid in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by preserving natural carbon sinks, such as forests, and promoting ecosystem services that support climate regulation. This synergy can reinforce efforts to achieve GHG reduction targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;GHG Removal;+3;Indivisible;The restoration of forests is inextricably linked to the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, as forests act as significant carbon sinks. This connection is essential for achieving net-zero emissions and mitigating climate change.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Climate Resilience;+1;Enabling;Urban nature conservation can enable climate resilience by providing ecosystem services such as urban cooling, air purification, and flood protection, which help cities adapt to the impacts of climate change.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;GHG Reduction;+2;Reinforcing;Sustainable agricultural practices and the restoration of agricultural ecosystems can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting soil carbon sequestration, efficient water use, and the reduction of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.30,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;GHG Reduction;+1;Enabling;The restoration of marine ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses, can enable GHG reduction by promoting blue carbon sinks that absorb and store carbon dioxide.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;GHG Reduction - Transports;+1;Enabling;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices can reduce the carbon footprint of the fishing industry by promoting more efficient fishing methods, reducing fuel consumption, and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources in transportation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.21,TA6.29,TA6.31,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;GHG Removal;+2;Reinforcing;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems, including wetlands, grasslands, and forests, can reinforce GHG removal efforts by enhancing natural carbon sinks, promoting soil carbon sequestration, and supporting ecosystem services that regulate the climate.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Climate Resilience;+1;Enabling;Effective monitoring of biodiversity can enable climate resilience by providing essential data on ecosystem health, allowing for the early detection of climate-related threats, and informing conservation and restoration efforts that support ecosystem resilience.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;GHG Reduction;+1;Enabling;The restoration of river ecosystems can enable GHG reduction by promoting natural flood control, enhancing water quality, and supporting aquatic biodiversity, which in turn can contribute to reduced emissions from land use changes and water management.
