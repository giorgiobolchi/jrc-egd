GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Air Quality;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can lead to improved air quality by decreasing the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere, which in turn can aid in achieving better air quality.;The connection between GHG reduction and air quality improvement is well-established, as many GHG reduction strategies also reduce air pollutants.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Improve Water Quality;+1;Reducing GHG emissions can create conditions that further improve water quality by reducing pollution from industrial and agricultural activities.;This is because some GHG reduction measures, like increasing energy efficiency or switching to renewable energy sources, can also decrease water pollution.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Improve Soils Health;+1;Improving energy efficiency in buildings and reducing their GHG emissions can create conditions that further soil health by reducing the need for fossil fuels and decreasing air pollution.;This connection is based on the idea that reducing energy consumption in buildings can lead to a decrease in the environmental impacts associated with energy production.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.14,TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Noise Reduction;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions from transportation can aid in reducing noise pollution by promoting the use of cleaner, quieter vehicles.;This is because electric or hybrid vehicles, which are often promoted as part of GHG reduction strategies, tend to be quieter than traditional combustion engine vehicles.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Improve Soils Health;+2;GHG removal strategies, such as afforestation or soil carbon sequestration, can directly aid in improving soil health by enhancing carbon storage and reducing erosion.;This connection is based on the direct impact of GHG removal methods on soil quality and fertility.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Social Security - Sanitation;+1;Reducing GHG emissions can create conditions that further improve social security and sanitation by reducing the economic and health burdens associated with climate change.;This is because addressing GHG emissions can lead to more resilient and sustainable communities, which in turn can better provide for social security and sanitation needs.
