GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can aid in the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems by mitigating climate change impacts, thus reinforcing the achievement of targets related to ecosystem restoration.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;Reducing GHG emissions helps in preserving biodiversity by reducing the stressors that come with climate change, such as extreme weather events and rising temperatures, which can lead to loss of habitats and extinction of species.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-1;The production of biofuels can compete with food crops for land use, potentially constraining the restoration of agricultural ecosystems and affecting biodiversity.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+3;Hydrogen distribution is indivisible from the development and use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which are a key component of achieving net-zero emissions in the road transport sector.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;Transport Logistics;+1;Improving urban mobility through sustainable transport options can enable more efficient logistics by reducing congestion and promoting cleaner transportation methods, thus supporting the overall reduction of emissions in the transport sector.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;Rail;+2;Enhancing transport logistics can reinforce the use of rail as a more sustainable mode of transportation by improving the efficiency and reducing the costs associated with rail transport, making it a more viable option for both passengers and freight.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+1;The development of other low-carbon fuels can enable the fishing industry to transition away from fossil fuels, reducing pollution and protecting marine biodiversity.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;The transition to net-zero technology in road vehicles can reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, creating a healthier environment that can reinforce the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+2;The development of rail infrastructure can aid in the restoration of rivers by reducing the need for road transport and thus minimizing the construction of roads that can fragment habitats and increase pollution in river ecosystems.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;-1;The extraction and processing of materials needed for hydrogen distribution infrastructure can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems, such as pollution and habitat destruction, thus constraining efforts to restore these ecosystems.
