Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.11,TA3.12;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;The reduction of waste can aid in the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems by decreasing pollution and preserving natural resources, which in turn can help to achieve the targets of terrestrial ecosystems restoration.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+1;Proper management of municipal waste can create conditions that further the restoration of agricultural ecosystems, as it reduces the amount of waste that ends up in these ecosystems and preserves soil health.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-1;Reducing food waste can limit options for agricultural ecosystems restoration, as it may reduce the availability of organic matter that can be used to improve soil health.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+2;The reduction of plastic waste can significantly aid in the restoration of marine ecosystems, as it decreases the amount of plastic pollution that ends up in oceans and harms marine life.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;Promoting circularity and recycling can help to restore terrestrial ecosystems by reducing the demand for raw materials and decreasing waste, which can help to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+1;Increasing recycling rates for municipal waste can create conditions that further the restoration of agricultural ecosystems, as it reduces the amount of waste that ends up in these ecosystems and preserves soil health.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;-2;The extraction of critical raw materials can counteract the restoration of forests, as it may lead to deforestation and habitat destruction, which can harm biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+1;The development of net-zero technologies can create conditions that further the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems, as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps to mitigate climate change, which can help to preserve ecosystem services and biodiversity.
