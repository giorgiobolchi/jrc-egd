GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is closely linked to the increase in renewable energy production, as renewable energy sources are a key component of a low-carbon economy. The implementation of GHG reduction targets will likely reinforce the development and use of renewable energy sources.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Energy Efficiency;+2;Improving energy efficiency is a crucial step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the implementation of GHG reduction targets will likely aid in the achievement of energy efficiency goals. Energy-efficient technologies and practices can help reduce energy consumption, which in turn reduces emissions.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Food affordability;+1;The development of competitive agriculture can enable the production of high-quality, affordable food, which can contribute to food affordability. By increasing agricultural productivity and efficiency, farmers can reduce costs and provide more affordable food options for consumers.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Food quality;+2;Reducing pesticide use can have a positive impact on food quality, as it can lead to the production of safer, healthier food. The implementation of pesticide reduction targets can reinforce the achievement of food quality goals, as it promotes more sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Food quality - Healthy Food;+1;Improving animal welfare in agriculture can have a positive impact on food quality, particularly in terms of healthy food. By promoting better animal welfare, farmers can produce higher-quality, more nutritious food, which can contribute to healthier diets.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Competitive Agriculture;+1;Ensuring food affordability can have a positive impact on competitive agriculture, as it can lead to increased demand for affordable, high-quality food. By promoting competitive agriculture, farmers can produce food at lower costs, making it more accessible to consumers.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-1;The reduction of pesticide use may constrain the development of renewable energy sources, such as hydrogen production, which may rely on pesticides for the production of feedstocks. However, this constraint can be mitigated by the development of more sustainable agricultural practices.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Renewable Energy;-2;The development of competitive agriculture may counteract the development of renewable energy sources, as it may lead to increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, this counteraction can be mitigated by the implementation of more sustainable agricultural practices and the use of renewable energy sources in agriculture.
