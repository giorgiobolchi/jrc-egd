Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;Urban Mobility;-1;The implementation of waste reduction targets in municipal waste may constrain urban mobility by limiting the availability of land for transportation infrastructure.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;Biofuels;+1;Reducing food waste can enable the production of biofuels by providing a source of organic matter for conversion into energy.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The recycling of critical raw materials from batteries can reinforce the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles by providing a secure supply of essential materials.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;-2;The extraction and import of critical raw materials can counteract the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles if the production processes are not sustainable and generate significant environmental impacts.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Hydrogen Distribution;+3;The development of net-zero technology in manufacturing is indivisible from the distribution of hydrogen, as hydrogen is a key component in the production of many net-zero technologies.
Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Transport Logistics;-1;The recycling of plastic and packaging can constrain transport logistics by requiring additional infrastructure and processes for the collection and processing of recyclable materials.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.30,TA3.40;Urban Mobility;+1;Reducing waste from plastic and packaging can enable urban mobility by reducing the amount of waste that needs to be transported and processed.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+2;The development of circular economy practices can reinforce the production of other low-carbon fuels by providing a source of organic matter for conversion into energy.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;Rail;-1;The recycling of textile waste can constrain the development of rail transportation by competing for resources and infrastructure.
