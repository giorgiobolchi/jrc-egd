Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;GHG Reduction;+2;The implementation of competitive agriculture targets, such as securing access to quality seeds and promoting sustainable agriculture, can aid in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by promoting more efficient farming practices and reducing synthetic fertilizer use.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;GHG Removal;-1;However, the focus on competitive agriculture might also constrain efforts to remove greenhouse gases, as the emphasis on productivity and efficiency could lead to increased energy consumption and land use changes that counteract carbon sequestration efforts.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;GHG Reduction;+1;Ensuring affordable food can enable the achievement of GHG reduction targets by promoting sustainable consumption patterns and reducing food waste, which in turn can lower the carbon footprint of the food system.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;GHG Removal;+1;Affordable food initiatives can also create conditions that further GHG removal by supporting the development of sustainable agriculture practices that enhance carbon sequestration in soils and reduce synthetic fertilizer use.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;GHG Reduction;+2;Reducing pesticide use can reinforce GHG reduction efforts by decreasing the energy required for pesticide production and application, and by promoting more sustainable farming practices that sequester carbon.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;GHG Removal;+2;The reduction of pesticides can also aid in GHG removal by promoting agroecological practices that enhance soil carbon sequestration and reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers, which are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;GHG Reduction;+1;Promoting healthy and sustainable food choices can enable the achievement of GHG reduction targets by reducing the demand for resource-intensive and greenhouse gas-emitting food products.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;GHG Removal;+1;Healthy food initiatives can also create conditions that further GHG removal by supporting the development of sustainable food systems that prioritize local, seasonal, and organic production, which can enhance carbon sequestration and reduce transportation emissions.
