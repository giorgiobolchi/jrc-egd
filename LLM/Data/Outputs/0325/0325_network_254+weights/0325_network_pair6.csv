Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7;GHG Reduction;+;2;The expansion of solar energy in the Renewable Energy - Solar sub-theme contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the GHG Reduction sub-theme, as solar power is a clean and renewable energy source. Increasing solar energy production helps decrease dependence on fossil fuels and lowers emissions.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;GHG Reduction;+;1;The Social Security - Energy sub-theme enables the achievement of GHG reduction targets in the GHG Reduction sub-theme by ensuring that energy poor and vulnerable consumers have access to clean and affordable energy. This support mechanism helps in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;GHG Reduction;+;2;The development of offshore renewable energy in the Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore sub-theme reinforces the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the GHG Reduction sub-theme, as offshore wind and other ocean energies are renewable and emit less greenhouse gases than traditional fossil fuels.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;GHG Removal;+;1;Improving energy efficiency in the Energy Efficiency sub-theme creates conditions that further the removal of greenhouse gases in the GHG Removal sub-theme, as more efficient energy use can lead to increased carbon capture and storage or utilization. This indirect support is beneficial for achieving net-zero emissions.
Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;GHG Removal;+;1;The implementation of renewable energy targets in the Renewable Energy sub-theme enables the removal of greenhouse gases in the GHG Removal sub-theme, as a transition to renewable energy sources can facilitate carbon capture and storage or utilization technologies, indirectly supporting GHG removal efforts.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.4;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;2;The Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling sub-theme aids in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the GHG Reduction - Buildings sub-theme, as renewable heating and cooling solutions emit less greenhouse gases than traditional systems. This synergy is essential for decreasing building emissions.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;2;The development of renewable hydrogen production in the Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production sub-theme supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the GHG Reduction - Transports sub-theme, as hydrogen can be used as a clean fuel for transportation, reducing emissions from this sector.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;GHG Reduction;+;2;The Energy Efficiency - Buildings sub-theme reinforces the achievement of GHG reduction targets in the GHG Reduction sub-theme, as energy-efficient buildings directly contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is achieved through reduced energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources in buildings.
