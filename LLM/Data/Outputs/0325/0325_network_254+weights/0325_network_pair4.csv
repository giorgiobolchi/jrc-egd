GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;Reinforcing;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate climate change, which in turn can reinforce biodiversity protection and conservation efforts by reducing the pressure of climate-related stressors on ecosystems.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;Reinforcing;GHG reduction targets can reinforce terrestrial ecosystems restoration by promoting sustainable land use practices, reducing deforestation, and encouraging reforestation, which helps to sequester carbon dioxide.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+1;Enabling;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can enable the restoration of forests by reducing the demand for wood and other forest products, thereby creating conditions for forest regeneration.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+1;Enabling;GHG removal technologies can enable marine ecosystem restoration by reducing ocean acidification, which is caused by the absorption of CO2 by the oceans, and promoting the health of marine ecosystems.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+2;Reinforcing;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate climate change, which in turn can reinforce biodiversity protection and conservation efforts in fisheries by reducing the impact of climate-related stressors on fish populations and habitats.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.14,TA1.16;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+1;Enabling;Improving energy efficiency in transportation can enable the restoration of agricultural ecosystems by reducing the demand for fossil fuels, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+2;Reinforcing;Enhancing climate resilience can reinforce biodiversity protection and conservation efforts in urban areas by promoting green infrastructure, reducing the urban heat island effect, and creating habitats for urban wildlife.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;+1;Enabling;Reducing GHG emissions can enable the restoration of rivers by promoting sustainable water management practices, reducing pollution, and encouraging the conservation of riverine ecosystems.
