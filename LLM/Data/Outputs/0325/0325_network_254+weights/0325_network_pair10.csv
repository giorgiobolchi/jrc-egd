Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in land use for fossil fuel extraction and production, thereby potentially freeing up land for ecosystem restoration.;The report highlights the importance of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change, which can have a positive impact on terrestrial ecosystems.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+1;The production of renewable hydrogen can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes, which can have a positive impact on biodiversity by reducing air pollution.;However, the report also notes that the extraction of raw materials for hydrogen production can have negative environmental impacts, which could potentially harm biodiversity.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-1;Improving energy efficiency in agricultural practices can lead to increased food production, which may result in increased land use and potentially constrain ecosystem restoration efforts.;The report emphasizes the need to balance energy efficiency with environmental protection and sustainable land use practices.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+2;Energy-efficient buildings can help reduce urban heat islands and improve air quality, which can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity.;The report highlights the importance of sustainable urban planning and green infrastructure in promoting biodiversity and mitigating the urban heat island effect.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+1;The deployment of solar energy can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable land use practices, which can have a positive impact on forest ecosystems.;However, the report also notes that large-scale solar deployments can have negative environmental impacts, such as land fragmentation and habitat destruction.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+1;The promotion of renewable energy-based social security programs can help reduce energy poverty and promote sustainable livelihoods, which can have a positive impact on biodiversity conservation in fishing communities.;The report emphasizes the importance of addressing energy poverty and promoting sustainable development in vulnerable communities.
Methane;TA5.4;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-2;Reducing methane emissions from agricultural practices can help mitigate climate change, but may also lead to increased use of synthetic fertilizers, which can have negative impacts on soil health and ecosystem restoration.;The report highlights the need to balance methane reduction efforts with sustainable agricultural practices and ecosystem restoration.
