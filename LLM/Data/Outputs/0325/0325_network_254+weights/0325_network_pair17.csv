Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Air Quality;+;2;Reducing waste can lead to lower emissions of air pollutants, thus improving air quality. Effective waste management is essential for minimizing the environmental impacts of waste disposal.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Water Quality;+;2;Proper management of municipal waste can prevent pollution of water bodies, thereby improving water quality. This is achieved through the reduction of waste that ends up in rivers, lakes, and oceans.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;Improve Soils Health;+;1;Reducing food waste can lead to more efficient use of soil and water resources, which can contribute to improved soil health. This is because less food waste means less pressure on agricultural land and water resources.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.30,TA3.40;Improve Water Quality;+;2;Reducing plastic waste can help prevent marine pollution, which is essential for maintaining good water quality. This is particularly important for marine ecosystems, where plastic waste can have devastating effects on wildlife.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;Improve Air Quality;+;1;Promoting circularity and recycling can lead to reduced emissions from production processes, which can improve air quality. This is because recycling often requires less energy than producing new materials from raw resources.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Improve Soils Health;+;1;Recycling municipal waste can help to recover valuable materials and reduce the need for landfills, which can contribute to improved soil health. This is because landfills can pollute soil and groundwater if not properly managed.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;Improve Water Quality;+;1;Recycling textile waste can help reduce the environmental impacts of the textile industry, including water pollution. This is because textile production often requires large amounts of water and can result in significant water pollution if not managed properly.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Improve Air Quality;+;1;Responsible extraction and import of critical raw materials can help reduce the environmental impacts of mining, including air pollution. This is because mining can result in significant air pollution if not managed properly.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Improve Air Quality;+;2;Promoting net-zero technology manufacturing can lead to reduced emissions from production processes, which can improve air quality. This is because net-zero technologies often require less energy and can reduce emissions from production processes.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Improve Water Quality;+;2;Recycling critical raw materials from batteries can help prevent pollution of water bodies, thereby improving water quality. This is achieved through the reduction of waste that ends up in rivers, lakes, and oceans.
