Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Urban Mobility;+2;Reinforcing;Improving air quality can aid in creating healthier and more livable urban environments, which is a key aspect of urban mobility. This can reinforce the achievement of urban mobility targets by making cities more attractive and sustainable.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14,TA7.15;Hydrogen Distribution;-1;Constraining;Improving water quality may limit the options for hydrogen distribution, as the production of hydrogen often relies on water resources. This can constrain the development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Biofuels;+1;Enabling;Improving soil health can create conditions that further the development of biofuels, as healthy soils can support the growth of biofuel crops. This can enable the achievement of biofuel targets by providing a sustainable source of feedstock.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Transport Logistics;-2;Counteracting;Reducing noise pollution may clash with the development of transport logistics, as the increased use of transportation modes can generate more noise. This can counteract the achievement of noise reduction targets.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+3;Indivisible;Improving social security and sanitation is inextricably linked to the development of net-zero technology for road vehicles, as the transition to cleaner vehicles can improve public health and reduce pollution. This is essential for achieving the targets of both sub-themes.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14,TA7.15;Rail;+2;Reinforcing;Improving water quality can aid in creating a healthier environment for rail transportation, which can reinforce the achievement of rail targets by making rail a more sustainable and attractive mode of transportation.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;-1;Constraining;Improving soil health may limit the options for other low-carbon fuels, as the production of these fuels often relies on land use and soil resources. This can constrain the development of other low-carbon fuel sources.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Urban Mobility;+1;Enabling;Reducing noise pollution can create conditions that further the development of urban mobility, as quieter cities can improve the quality of life for citizens. This can enable the achievement of urban mobility targets by making cities more livable and sustainable.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Transport Logistics;+2;Reinforcing;Improving social security and sanitation can aid in creating a healthier environment for transport logistics, which can reinforce the achievement of transport logistics targets by making transportation modes more sustainable and efficient.

Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14,TA7.15;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+1;Enabling;Improving water quality can create conditions that further the development of other low-carbon fuels, as healthy aquatic ecosystems can support the growth of algae and other aquatic biofuels. This can enable the achievement of other low-carbon fuel targets by providing a sustainable source of feedstock.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Urban Mobility;-2;Counteracting;Improving soil health may clash with the development of urban mobility, as the expansion of urban areas can lead to soil degradation and loss of fertile land. This can counteract the achievement of urban mobility targets by making cities less sustainable and more prone to environmental degradation.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Rail;+2;Reinforcing;Reducing noise pollution can aid in creating a healthier environment for rail transportation, which can reinforce the achievement of rail targets by making rail a more sustainable and attractive mode of transportation.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Biofuels;+1;Enabling;Improving social security and sanitation can create conditions that further the development of biofuels, as the transition to cleaner energy sources can improve public health and reduce pollution. This can enable the achievement of biofuel targets by providing a sustainable source of energy.
