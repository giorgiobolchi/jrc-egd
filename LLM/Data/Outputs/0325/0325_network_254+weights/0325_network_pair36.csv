Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.14,TA7.15,TA7.2,TA7.23,TA7.24,TA7.4,TA7.7;GHG Reduction;+2;The improvement of water quality can aid in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by promoting more efficient use of water resources, which in turn can lead to reduced energy consumption for water treatment and pumping.;The connection between water quality and GHG reduction is reinforced by the fact that better water management can reduce the need for energy-intensive water treatment processes.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;GHG Reduction;+2;Improving air quality can contribute to GHG reduction by reducing the need for air pollution control measures that consume energy, and by promoting the use of cleaner energy sources.;This connection is based on the understanding that air quality improvement and GHG reduction are intertwined, as cleaner air often results from reduced emissions of pollutants that also contribute to climate change.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Removal;+1;Soil health improvement can create conditions that enhance carbon sequestration, a key aspect of GHG removal, by increasing the soil's capacity to act as a carbon sink.;This connection is grounded in the idea that healthy soils can absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus contributing to GHG removal efforts.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;GHG Reduction - Transports;+1;Reducing noise pollution can create an environment that encourages the use of cleaner transportation modes, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, which in turn can lead to reduced GHG emissions from the transport sector.;This link is based on the premise that less noise pollution can make alternative, quieter modes of transport more appealing, thereby indirectly supporting GHG reduction in the transport sector.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+1;Improving sanitation and social security can lead to better living conditions, which might include more energy-efficient buildings and homes, thereby contributing to reduced GHG emissions from the buildings sector.;This connection assumes that improved social security and sanitation can lead to investments in more sustainable and energy-efficient housing, which in turn supports GHG reduction efforts.
