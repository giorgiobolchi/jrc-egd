Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The improvement of water quality can reinforce waste reduction efforts in municipal waste by reducing the amount of waste that enters water bodies, thus aiding in the achievement of waste reduction targets.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;Better water quality can facilitate the recycling of municipal waste by reducing contamination, thereby reinforcing circularity and recycling efforts.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+1;Healthy soils can enable the sustainable extraction of critical raw materials, creating conditions that further the development of net-zero technologies and manufacturing.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;-1;The focus on improving soil health might constrain the options for critical raw material extraction, as prioritizing soil conservation could limit areas available for mining.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;Reducing noise pollution can create conditions that further waste reduction efforts by promoting quieter, more efficient waste management practices.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;Improved sanitation can reinforce waste reduction efforts by reducing the amount of waste generated and promoting proper waste disposal, thus aiding in the achievement of municipal waste reduction targets.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;Better sanitation can facilitate the recycling of municipal waste by reducing contamination and promoting a culture of recycling, thereby reinforcing circularity efforts.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+1;Improving air quality can create conditions that further waste reduction efforts in plastic and packaging by promoting the use of cleaner production methods and materials.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;-1;The focus on improving air quality might constrain the options for plastic and packaging waste reduction, as some measures to improve air quality could inadvertently increase plastic use or limit recycling options.
