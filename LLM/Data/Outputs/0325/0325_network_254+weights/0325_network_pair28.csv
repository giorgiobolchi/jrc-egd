GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+2;The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can aid in the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems by mitigating climate change impacts, thus reinforcing efforts in this area. This connection is based on the understanding that climate change affects ecosystem health and biodiversity.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+3;Reducing pesticide use is indivisible from biodiversity conservation, as pesticides can harm wildlife and pollinators, making their reduction crucial for protecting biodiversity. This is a key aspect of the European Green Deal's focus on both climate action and environmental protection.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.21;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+1;Promoting competitive agriculture can enable the restoration of agricultural ecosystems by encouraging sustainable farming practices, which in turn can help in restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services. This connection highlights the importance of sustainable agriculture in achieving environmental goals.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Food quality;+2;Ensuring food affordability can reinforce the quality of food by making sustainable and healthy food options more accessible to a wider population, thus aiding in the achievement of better food quality. This is in line with the report's emphasis on making the food system fair, healthy, and environmentally friendly.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.33,TA5.34;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;Improving food quality, especially through healthy and sustainable diets, can reinforce biodiversity conservation by reducing the demand for resource-intensive and environmentally harmful food production methods. This connection is based on the report's discussion of the need for sustainable food systems.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+3;The reduction of pesticides is crucial for the restoration of agricultural ecosystems, as these chemicals can pollute soil and water, harming ecosystem health. This is a direct and significant impact, making pesticide reduction indivisible from agricultural ecosystem restoration.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+1;Improving animal welfare in food production can enable better conservation of marine biodiversity by promoting more sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices, which reduce the environmental impact of these industries. This connection is based on the understanding that animal welfare and environmental conservation are interconnected.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.21;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+2;Promoting competitive agriculture can reinforce biodiversity conservation by encouraging practices that protect natural habitats and promote ecosystem services, thus aiding in the conservation of biodiversity. This is in line with the report's emphasis on the importance of sustainable agriculture for environmental protection.
