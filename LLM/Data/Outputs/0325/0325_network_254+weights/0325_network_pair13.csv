Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Renewable Energy - Solar;+2;The reduction of municipal waste can lead to an increase in the availability of land for solar panel installations, thereby reinforcing the growth of solar energy production.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+1;Reducing municipal waste can create conditions for more energy-efficient buildings by promoting recycling and reuse of materials, which can lead to a reduction in energy consumption.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-1;The focus on recycling and circularity in municipal waste management might constrain the development of hydrogen production, as it may divert attention and resources away from this area.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Renewable Energy;+3;The extraction and import of critical raw materials are indivisible from the development of renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels, which rely heavily on these materials.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+2;The development of net-zero technology in manufacturing can reinforce energy efficiency in buildings by promoting the use of energy-efficient materials and production processes.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;+1;The recycling of critical raw materials from batteries can create conditions for the development of offshore renewable energy technologies, such as wind farms, by providing a stable supply of necessary materials.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Renewable Energy - Solar;-2;The reduction of plastic waste can counteract the growth of solar energy production, as some solar panels rely on plastic components, and a decrease in plastic production could limit the availability of these components.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;Social Security - Energy;+1;The recycling of textile waste can create conditions for improved social security in the energy sector by promoting sustainable and energy-efficient practices in the textile industry.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;Energy Efficiency;-1;The reduction of food waste can constrain energy efficiency efforts, as some food waste can be converted into energy through anaerobic digestion, and reducing food waste might limit the availability of this energy source.
