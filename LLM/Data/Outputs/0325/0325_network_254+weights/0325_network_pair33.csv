Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Transport Logistics;-2;The implementation of biodiversity protection and conservation targets may counteract the development of transport logistics, as the preservation of natural habitats and ecosystems may limit the construction of new transportation infrastructure.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Urban Mobility;+2;The protection and conservation of urban nature can reinforce urban mobility by promoting green spaces and reducing air pollution, making cities more livable and sustainable.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Biofuels;-1;The restoration of forests may constrain the production of biofuels, as it may limit the availability of land for biofuel crops.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+1;The restoration of marine ecosystems can enable the development of other low-carbon fuels, such as offshore wind and tidal energy, by creating a more favorable environment for these technologies.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;-3;The protection of fisheries and the development of net-zero technology for road vehicles are unrelated and do not have a direct impact on each other.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Hydrogen Distribution;+2;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can reinforce the development of hydrogen distribution, as it may promote the use of renewable energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Rail;+1;The protection and conservation of biodiversity can enable the development of rail transportation, as it may promote the use of more sustainable and environmentally-friendly modes of transportation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Urban Mobility;-2;The restoration of rivers may counteract urban mobility, as it may limit the construction of new transportation infrastructure and promote more sustainable and environmentally-friendly modes of transportation.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Transport Logistics;-1;The monitoring of biodiversity may constrain the development of transport logistics, as it may limit the construction of new transportation infrastructure and promote more sustainable and environmentally-friendly modes of transportation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can reinforce the development of net-zero technology for road vehicles, as it may promote the use of renewable energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Rail;+1;The protection and conservation of urban nature can enable the development of rail transportation, as it may promote the use of more sustainable and environmentally-friendly modes of transportation.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Hydrogen Distribution;+2;The restoration of marine ecosystems can reinforce the development of hydrogen distribution, as it may promote the use of renewable energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;-1;The restoration of forests may constrain the production of other low-carbon fuels, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, as it may limit the availability of land for these technologies.
