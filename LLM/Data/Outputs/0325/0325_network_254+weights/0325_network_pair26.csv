GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;The reduction of GHG emissions can aid in the reduction of waste by promoting more sustainable practices and reducing the need for landfills, which are significant sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+2;Reducing GHG emissions through circular economy practices can reinforce waste reduction and recycling efforts in municipalities by encouraging the reuse and recycling of materials, thus decreasing the amount of waste sent to landfills.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;Promoting competitive agriculture can enable the reduction of food waste by improving supply chain efficiency, reducing losses during production and processing, and enhancing the overall quality of agricultural products, making them more appealing to consumers and less likely to be wasted.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.5,TA5.7,TA6.26,TA6.9,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.21;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+1;Reducing pesticide use can create conditions that further the recycling of critical raw materials, such as those found in batteries, by promoting more sustainable agricultural practices that minimize environmental pollution and preserve natural resources.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;Food quality;+2;Ensuring food affordability can reinforce efforts to improve food quality by making healthier and more sustainable food options accessible to a wider population, thereby promoting better nutrition and reducing the environmental impact of food production.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+2;Improving food quality, especially in terms of healthiness, can aid in the reduction of food waste by promoting consumption of whole, nutrient-dense foods that are less likely to be discarded and by supporting sustainable food systems that minimize waste generation.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.5,TA5.7,TA6.26,TA6.9,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.21;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+1;Reducing pesticide use can create conditions that further improve animal welfare by promoting agricultural practices that are less harmful to animals and the environment, such as organic farming and integrated pest management, which can also enhance the quality of animal products.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Circularity/Recycling;+1;Promoting competitive agriculture can enable circular economy practices by encouraging the efficient use of resources, reducing waste, and promoting recycling and reuse in agricultural production and processing, thereby contributing to a more circular and sustainable food system.
Food quality;TA5.30,TA5.32;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+2;Improving food quality can reinforce efforts to reduce plastic and packaging waste by promoting sustainable packaging solutions, reducing food packaging overall, and encouraging the use of biodegradable or recyclable materials, which can significantly decrease plastic waste.
