GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;-2;The reduction of GHG emissions may lead to increased energy efficiency, potentially reducing waste generation in municipal waste management, but may also counteract waste reduction efforts if not properly managed.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling;+2;Reducing GHG emissions can aid the transition to a circular economy, reinforcing recycling and waste reduction efforts by promoting sustainable practices and reducing waste generation.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25,TA4.26,TA4.27,TA4.28,TA4.29,TA4.40,TA4.44,TA4.45,TA4.55;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+1;The development of net-zero technology in road vehicles can enable the creation of conditions for reducing plastic waste in packaging by promoting sustainable transportation options and reducing reliance on single-use plastics.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.5,TA4.6,TA4.7;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-1;The increased demand for critical raw materials required for other low-carbon fuels may constrain options for sustainable extraction and import, potentially limiting the availability of these materials for other applications.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+2;The production and use of biofuels can reinforce the development of net-zero technology in manufacturing by providing a low-carbon energy source for industrial processes, aiding in the reduction of GHG emissions.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+1;The distribution of hydrogen can create conditions for the recycling of critical raw materials in batteries by promoting the use of hydrogen fuel cells, which can aid in the recovery of valuable materials.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;-2;Improved urban mobility can counteract efforts to reduce food waste if it leads to increased food transportation and handling, potentially resulting in more waste generation.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37,TA4.39,TA4.43,TA4.50,TA4.51,TA4.56;Circularity/Recycling;-1;Efficient transport logistics can constrain options for circularity and recycling by prioritizing speed and cost-effectiveness over sustainability, potentially limiting the adoption of circular practices.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;Waste Reduction;+2;The development of rail infrastructure can reinforce waste reduction efforts by providing a low-carbon transportation option, reducing the need for fossil fuels and potentially decreasing waste generation in transportation.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;Circularity/Recycling;+1;The expansion of rail networks can create conditions for increased recycling by providing a efficient and low-carbon means of transporting recyclable materials, aiding in the circular economy.
