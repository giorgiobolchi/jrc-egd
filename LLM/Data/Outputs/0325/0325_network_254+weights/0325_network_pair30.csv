Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.62,TA6.8;GHG Reduction;-2;The implementation of biodiversity protection and conservation targets may counteract GHG reduction efforts, as some conservation measures may require significant energy consumption or land use changes that increase emissions.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;GHG Reduction;-1;Urban nature conservation efforts may constrain GHG reduction options, as urban green spaces may require energy-intensive maintenance or limit the availability of land for renewable energy installations.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;GHG Removal;+2;Forest restoration can reinforce GHG removal efforts, as forests act as carbon sinks and can help mitigate climate change.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;GHG Reduction;+1;Marine ecosystem restoration can enable GHG reduction efforts, as healthy marine ecosystems can help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;GHG Reduction;-1;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices may constrain GHG reduction options, as the fishing industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;GHG Reduction;+1;Sustainable agricultural practices can enable GHG reduction efforts, as they can help reduce synthetic fertilizer use and promote soil carbon sequestration.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;GHG Reduction;-1;Biodiversity monitoring efforts may constrain GHG reduction options, as they may require significant resources and infrastructure that increase emissions.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;GHG Removal;+3;Terrestrial ecosystem restoration is indivisible from GHG removal efforts, as restored ecosystems can act as significant carbon sinks and help mitigate climate change.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.62,TA6.8;GHG Removal;+2;Biodiversity protection and conservation efforts can reinforce GHG removal efforts, as preserved ecosystems can help sequester carbon dioxide and mitigate climate change.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;GHG Reduction;+1;River restoration can enable GHG reduction efforts, as healthy river ecosystems can help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide and promoting sustainable land use practices.
