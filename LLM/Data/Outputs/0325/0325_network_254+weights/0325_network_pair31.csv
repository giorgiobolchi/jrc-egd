Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Renewable Energy;-;2;The implementation of renewable energy sources may lead to the destruction of natural habitats, which could negatively impact biodiversity, thus constraining the achievement of biodiversity protection targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;1;Urban nature conservation can enable the implementation of energy-efficient buildings by providing green spaces that help reduce the urban heat island effect, thus creating conditions that further energy efficiency targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.11,TA6.47,TA6.48;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;2;The restoration of forests can aid the achievement of solar energy targets by providing shade and reducing the temperature, which can increase the efficiency of solar panels, thus reinforcing the growth of renewable energy.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;-;2;The restoration of marine ecosystems may limit the options for offshore renewable energy production, as the installation of offshore wind farms or other renewable energy infrastructure could harm marine life, thus counteracting the achievement of renewable energy targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;1;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices can enable the production of renewable hydrogen by providing a source of organic matter that can be converted into hydrogen, thus creating conditions that further renewable energy targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Energy Efficiency;+;2;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can aid the achievement of energy efficiency targets by reducing the energy required for agricultural production, thus reinforcing the growth of energy-efficient practices.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Social Security - Energy;+;1;The protection of biodiversity can enable the implementation of social security measures related to energy by providing ecosystem services that help reduce energy poverty, thus creating conditions that further social security targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Renewable Energy;-;2;The restoration of rivers may limit the options for renewable energy production, as the alteration of river flows could affect the operation of hydroelectric power plants, thus counteracting the achievement of renewable energy targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;1;The monitoring of biodiversity can enable the implementation of energy-efficient buildings by providing data on the impact of building construction on local ecosystems, thus creating conditions that further energy efficiency targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.9,TA5.11,TA6.10,TA6.11,TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.47,TA6.48,TA6.58,TA6.62;Renewable Energy;+;2;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can aid the achievement of renewable energy targets by providing biomass that can be converted into energy, thus reinforcing the growth of renewable energy.
