Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+2;Reinforcing;Proper waste management is essential for preserving biodiversity, and reducing municipal waste can help minimize pollution and protect ecosystems. Effective waste reduction strategies can reinforce biodiversity conservation efforts.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Circularity/Recycling;+2;Reinforcing;Circular economy practices can help reduce waste and promote sustainable consumption, which in turn can reinforce biodiversity protection by minimizing the environmental impacts of human activities. 
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+1;Enabling;Reducing food waste in urban areas can help minimize the environmental impacts of food production and consumption, creating conditions that enable biodiversity conservation in urban ecosystems.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-2;Counteracting;The extraction of critical raw materials for forest restoration can counteract the goal of reducing the environmental impacts of extraction and promoting sustainable resource management.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+3;Indivisible;Reducing plastic pollution is essential for marine ecosystem restoration, and circular economy practices can help minimize plastic waste and promote sustainable consumption, making it an indivisible aspect of marine conservation efforts.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+2;Reinforcing;Reducing plastic pollution in fisheries can help protect marine biodiversity, and waste reduction strategies can reinforce this effort by minimizing the amount of plastic waste that enters the ocean.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Circularity/Recycling;-1;Constraining;The focus on terrestrial ecosystem restoration might constrain the options for circular economy practices, as the emphasis on restoration might lead to increased resource extraction and consumption.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+1;Enabling;Effective monitoring of biodiversity can help identify areas where waste reduction efforts are needed, creating conditions that enable the implementation of waste management strategies that support biodiversity conservation.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+2;Reinforcing;Sustainable agricultural practices can help reduce food waste, and waste reduction strategies can reinforce this effort by promoting efficient food production and consumption systems.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Circularity/Recycling;+1;Enabling;Restoring rivers and promoting circular economy practices can help minimize waste and promote sustainable consumption, creating conditions that enable the conservation of riverine ecosystems.
