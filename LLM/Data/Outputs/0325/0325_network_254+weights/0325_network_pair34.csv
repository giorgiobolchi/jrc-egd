Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Food affordability;-1;The conservation of biodiversity might limit the availability of certain food products, potentially increasing their prices and affecting food affordability, especially for low-income households.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Competitive Agriculture;+3;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems is inextricably linked to competitive agriculture, as it aims to increase organic farming, improve soil health, and promote sustainable agricultural practices, all of which can enhance the competitiveness of the agricultural sector.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Pesticides Reduction;-2;The restoration of forests might counteract the reduction of pesticides, as some forest management practices could involve the use of pesticides, potentially hindering the achievement of pesticide reduction targets.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Food quality - Healthy Food;+1;The restoration of marine ecosystems can enable the improvement of food quality by promoting sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices, which can lead to healthier and more sustainable seafood production.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Food affordability;+1;The protection and restoration of urban nature can enable the improvement of food affordability by promoting urban agriculture, community gardens, and green spaces, which can increase access to fresh and healthy food, especially for low-income households.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+2;The conservation of fisheries and the protection of marine biodiversity can aid in the improvement of food quality by promoting sustainable and responsible fishing practices, which can lead to better animal welfare and healthier seafood production.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;Pesticides Reduction;+2;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can aid in the reduction of pesticides by promoting sustainable agricultural practices, improving soil health, and enhancing biodiversity, all of which can reduce the need for pesticides and minimize their harmful effects on the environment.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Food quality;+1;The monitoring of biodiversity can enable the improvement of food quality by providing insights into the health of ecosystems that support food production, allowing for more informed decision-making and sustainable practices.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Food affordability;-1;The restoration of rivers might limit the availability of water for agricultural purposes, potentially affecting food production and increasing food prices, especially for low-income households.
