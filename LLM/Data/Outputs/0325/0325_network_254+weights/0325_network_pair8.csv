Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+2;The increased use of renewable energy can aid the development of net-zero technology for road vehicles by providing a cleaner source of energy for transportation, thus reinforcing the achievement of this target.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21;Hydrogen Distribution;+3;The production of renewable hydrogen is inextricably linked to its distribution, as the development of hydrogen infrastructure is necessary for the widespread adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Urban Mobility;+1;Energy-efficient buildings can enable more sustainable urban mobility by reducing the energy needed for transportation and promoting the use of cleaner energy sources, thus creating conditions that further urban mobility targets.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+2;The growth of solar energy can reinforce the development of other low-carbon fuels by providing a competitive and clean source of energy, thus aiding the achievement of targets related to low-carbon fuels.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Urban Mobility;-1;Policies aimed at ensuring social security in the energy sector might constrain urban mobility targets if they prioritize energy access over sustainable transportation, thus limiting options for achieving urban mobility goals.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Transport Logistics;+2;Improving energy efficiency can reinforce transport logistics by reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of cleaner energy sources, thus aiding the achievement of targets related to transport logistics.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.4;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;-2;The focus on renewable energy for heating and cooling might counteract the development of net-zero technology for road vehicles if it diverts resources and attention away from transportation, thus clashing with the achievement of this target.
