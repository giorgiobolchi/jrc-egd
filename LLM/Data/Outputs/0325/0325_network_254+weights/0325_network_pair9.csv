Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;Food quality;+2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn can improve air quality and have a positive impact on food quality. This is because air pollution from fossil fuels can damage crops and reduce food yields.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40,TA4.1,TA4.20,TA4.21;Food affordability;+1;The production of renewable hydrogen can lead to the development of new technologies and industries, creating jobs and stimulating local economies, which can have a positive impact on food affordability. This is because local economic growth can lead to increased access to affordable and nutritious food.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Competitive Agriculture;-1;Improving energy efficiency can lead to increased costs for farmers and food producers, which could impact food prices and, in turn, food security, constraining the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. This is because energy-efficient technologies and practices may require significant upfront investments.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Food quality - Healthy Food;+1;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can lead to the creation of healthier indoor environments, which can have a positive impact on food quality and healthy eating habits. This is because energy-efficient buildings can reduce the need for artificial lighting and heating, creating a more natural and healthy environment.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7;Pesticides Reduction;+2;The increased use of solar energy can lead to a reduction in the use of pesticides, as solar-powered irrigation systems and other agricultural technologies can reduce the need for chemical pesticides. This is because solar energy can provide a reliable and consistent source of power for agricultural systems, reducing the need for fossil fuels and associated pollutants.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Food affordability;+1;Improving access to energy can have a positive impact on food affordability, as energy is a critical component of food production, processing, and distribution. This is because increased access to energy can lead to increased food availability and reduced costs, making food more affordable for low-income households.
