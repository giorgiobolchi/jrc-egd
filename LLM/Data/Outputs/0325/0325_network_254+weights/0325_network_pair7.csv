Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.13,TA2.14,TA2.15,TA2.16,TA2.17,TA2.18,TA2.19,TA2.2,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36,TA2.37,TA2.38,TA2.39,TA2.4,TA2.40,TA2.41,TA2.42,TA2.43,TA2.44,TA2.45,TA2.46,TA2.47,TA2.48,TA2.49,TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.8,TA2.9;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;2;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in waste generation from fossil fuels, which in turn can reduce municipal waste. This is because renewable energy sources like solar and wind power do not produce waste in the same way that fossil fuels do.
Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.13,TA2.14,TA2.15,TA2.16,TA2.17,TA2.18,TA2.19,TA2.2,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36,TA2.37,TA2.38,TA2.39,TA2.4,TA2.40,TA2.41,TA2.42,TA2.43,TA2.44,TA2.45,TA2.46,TA2.47,TA2.48,TA2.49,TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.8,TA2.9;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;2;The use of renewable energy can also enable the recycling of municipal waste by providing the necessary power for recycling facilities. This can lead to a more circular economy and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.4;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;1;The use of renewable energy for heating and cooling can help reduce food waste by providing a reliable and consistent source of energy for food storage and processing. This can help reduce the amount of food that is wasted due to spoilage or contamination.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.40,TA2.41,TA2.42,TA2.43,TA2.44;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;2;The production of renewable hydrogen may require the use of critical raw materials like platinum and iridium, which can lead to increased extraction and importation of these materials. This can have negative environmental and social impacts associated with mining and trade.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;2;The development of offshore renewable energy technologies can drive innovation and manufacturing in the net-zero technology sector. This can lead to the creation of new jobs and industries focused on sustainable energy production.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+;1;The use of solar energy can enable the recycling of plastic and packaging materials by providing a reliable source of power for recycling facilities. This can help reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and promote a more circular economy.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.22,TA2.23,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+;2;Improving energy efficiency can lead to a reduction in energy consumption, which in turn can reduce the production of plastic and packaging materials. This can help reduce waste generation and promote a more circular economy.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.18,TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.32,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;2;The use of energy-efficient buildings can reduce the demand for critical raw materials used in batteries, which can lead to an increase in the recycling of these materials. This can help reduce waste generation and promote a more circular economy.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;1;The use of social security measures to support energy access can help reduce waste generation from fossil fuels, which in turn can reduce municipal waste. This is because renewable energy sources like solar and wind power do not produce waste in the same way that fossil fuels do.
