Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Improve Air Quality;+2;Reinforcing;Biodiversity protection and conservation can aid in improving air quality by preserving natural habitats that absorb pollutants and produce oxygen, thus reinforcing efforts to enhance air quality.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;Improve Water Quality;+2;Reinforcing;Conservation of biodiversity, especially in aquatic ecosystems, can contribute to improving water quality by maintaining healthy river flows, reducing pollution, and preserving aquatic life, which in turn reinforces water quality improvement efforts.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Improve Air Quality;+2;Reinforcing;Restoring forests can significantly improve air quality by increasing oxygen production, absorbing carbon dioxide, and filtering out pollutants, thereby reinforcing air quality improvement initiatives.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Improve Soils Health;+3;Indivisible;Restoring agricultural ecosystems is inextricably linked to improving soil health, as it involves practices like organic farming, agroforestry, and permaculture that enhance soil fertility, structure, and biodiversity, making it essential for achieving soil health targets.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Improve Water Quality;+2;Reinforcing;Restoring marine ecosystems can contribute to improving water quality by preserving coral reefs, which protect coastlines from erosion and filter out pollutants, and by maintaining healthy fish populations, which help to keep the ocean's nutrient cycles in balance, thus reinforcing water quality improvement efforts.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Improve Air Quality;+1;Enabling;Urban nature conservation can enable improvements in air quality by creating green spaces that absorb pollutants, produce oxygen, and provide shade, which can help mitigate the urban heat island effect and create conditions that further air quality improvement.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Improve Water Quality;+2;Reinforcing;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices can aid in improving water quality by reducing pollution from fishing gear and feed, and by preserving aquatic habitats that filter out pollutants, thus reinforcing water quality improvement efforts.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Improve Water Quality;+3;Indivisible;Restoring river ecosystems is inextricably linked to improving water quality, as it involves preserving natural river flows, reducing pollution, and maintaining healthy aquatic life, making it essential for achieving water quality targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Improve Air Quality;+1;Enabling;Monitoring biodiversity can enable improvements in air quality by providing data on the health of ecosystems, which can inform conservation efforts and create conditions that further air quality improvement initiatives.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;Improve Soils Health;+3;Indivisible;Restoring terrestrial ecosystems is inextricably linked to improving soil health, as it involves practices like reforestation, afforestation, and land rehabilitation that enhance soil fertility, structure, and biodiversity, making it essential for achieving soil health targets.
