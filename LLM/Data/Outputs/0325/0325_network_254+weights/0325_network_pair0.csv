GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;-2;The reduction of GHG emissions through measures like TA1.3 and TA1.7 may counteract the growth of renewable energy sources if not managed carefully, as the focus on emissions reduction could lead to an over-reliance on traditional energy sources.;The balance between GHG reduction and renewable energy growth is crucial for a sustainable transition.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Energy Efficiency;+2;Implementing energy efficiency measures as part of GHG reduction strategies (like TA1.9) reinforces the overall goal of reducing energy consumption and thereby supports energy efficiency.;This synergy is essential for achieving both GHG reduction and energy efficiency targets.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+3;The reduction of GHG emissions from buildings through strategies like TA1.15 is indivisible from improving energy efficiency in buildings, as both targets aim at minimizing energy waste and optimizing building performance.;Achieving one target directly contributes to achieving the other.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+1;GHG removal technologies can enable the production of renewable hydrogen by utilizing captured CO2 for hydrogen production, thus enabling renewable energy sources.;This connection supports the growth of renewable energy sources by providing a new avenue for hydrogen production.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Social Security - Energy;+1;Enhancing climate resilience through measures like TA1.1 and TA1.4 can create conditions that further social security in the energy sector by ensuring that energy systems are adaptable and resilient to climate change.;This helps in maintaining energy access and security during climate-related events.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Methane;-2;Strategies to reduce GHG emissions might counteract efforts to specifically address methane emissions if methane reduction is not explicitly prioritized within the broader GHG reduction targets.;Methane has a high global warming potential, and its reduction is critical for overall GHG emission reduction.
