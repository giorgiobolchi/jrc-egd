Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;GHG Reduction;+2;The reduction of municipal waste can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration are significant contributors to GHG emissions. Effective waste reduction strategies can reinforce GHG reduction efforts.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;GHG Reduction;+2;Implementing circular economy practices and increasing recycling rates in municipal waste management can reduce the need for primary materials, lower energy consumption, and decrease GHG emissions, thus reinforcing GHG reduction targets.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;GHG Reduction;+1;Reducing food waste can lead to a decrease in the production, transportation, and storage of food, resulting in lower GHG emissions. This enables GHG reduction efforts by creating conditions that further reduce emissions.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;GHG Reduction;+1;The secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials can enable the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies, creating conditions that further GHG reduction efforts.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;GHG Reduction;+3;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies are indivisible from GHG reduction efforts, as these technologies are essential for achieving a net-zero economy and reducing GHG emissions.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;GHG Reduction;+2;The recycling of critical raw materials from batteries can reduce the need for primary materials, lower energy consumption, and decrease GHG emissions, thus reinforcing GHG reduction targets.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.29,TA3.30,TA3.40;GHG Removal;+1;Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling rates can lead to a decrease in the production of new plastics, which are often made from fossil fuels and contribute to GHG emissions. This enables GHG removal efforts by creating conditions that further reduce emissions.
Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37,TA3.39,TA3.40;GHG Removal;+2;Implementing circular economy practices and increasing recycling rates in plastic and packaging waste management can reduce the need for primary materials, lower energy consumption, and decrease GHG emissions, thus reinforcing GHG removal targets.
