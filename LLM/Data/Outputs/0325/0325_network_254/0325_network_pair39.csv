Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+;The improvement of air quality can positively influence the development and implementation of net-zero technology in road vehicles, as cleaner air can enhance the performance and efficiency of electric and hybrid vehicles. This can lead to increased adoption and reduced emissions.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.7;Hydrogen Distribution;-;The improvement of water quality may have a negative impact on hydrogen distribution, as the production of hydrogen often requires significant amounts of water, which can strain local water resources and potentially compromise water quality.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Biofuels;+;The improvement of soil health can positively influence the production of biofuels, as healthier soils can lead to increased crop yields and better nutrient management, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and minimizing soil degradation.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Urban Mobility;+;The reduction of noise pollution can positively influence urban mobility, as quieter cities can lead to improved quality of life, increased pedestrian activity, and enhanced overall livability, making urban areas more attractive and sustainable.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Transport Logistics;-;The improvement of social security and sanitation may have a negative impact on transport logistics, as increased focus on sanitation and public health can lead to more stringent regulations and controls on transportation, potentially increasing costs and reducing efficiency.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.7;Rail;+;The improvement of water quality can positively influence the development of rail transportation, as rail infrastructure often relies on water resources for cooling and other operational purposes, and improved water quality can reduce maintenance costs and enhance overall efficiency.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+;The improvement of soil health can positively influence the production of other low-carbon fuels, such as biogas and renewable natural gas, as healthier soils can lead to increased crop yields and better nutrient management, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and minimizing soil degradation.
