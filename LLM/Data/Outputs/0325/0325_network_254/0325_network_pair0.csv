GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Renewable Energy;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets can lead to an increased demand for renewable energy sources, driving the growth of the renewable energy sector. This is because reducing GHG emissions often involves transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Energy Efficiency;+;GHG reduction targets can also promote energy efficiency, as reducing energy consumption is often a key strategy for decreasing emissions. This can lead to increased investment in energy-efficient technologies and practices, benefiting the energy efficiency sector.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in buildings can lead to improved energy efficiency in the building sector, driving the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and practices. This can result in cost savings and reduced emissions for building owners and occupants.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Renewable Energy;+;GHG removal technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, can be used to reduce emissions from renewable energy sources, making them even cleaner and more viable. This can increase the attractiveness of renewable energy sources and drive their adoption.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Social Security - Energy;-;The implementation of climate resilience targets may require significant investment in infrastructure and technology, potentially diverting resources away from social security and energy accessibility programs. This could negatively impact vulnerable populations who rely on these programs for energy access and security.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Methane;+;Reducing GHG emissions can involve decreasing methane emissions, which are a potent greenhouse gas. This can lead to increased investment in methane reduction technologies and practices, benefiting the methane reduction sector.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA2.13;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in the transport sector can lead to increased demand for low-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen. This can drive the growth of the renewable energy - hydrogen production sector, as hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in buildings can lead to increased adoption of on-site renewable energy generation, such as solar panels. This can drive the growth of the renewable energy - solar sector, as building owners and occupants seek to reduce their emissions and energy costs.
