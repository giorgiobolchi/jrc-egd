Food quality;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+;Improving food quality through sustainable agriculture practices can contribute to the restoration of agricultural ecosystems, promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+;Enhancing animal welfare in agriculture can lead to more sustainable farming practices, which in turn can contribute to the restoration of agricultural ecosystems.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-;Ensuring food affordability might lead to increased pressure on agricultural ecosystems, potentially hindering restoration efforts.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5,TA6.26,TA6.9,TA7.21;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;Reducing pesticide use can help protect biodiversity, as pesticides can harm non-target species and contaminate soil and water.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+;Promoting competitive agriculture through sustainable practices can contribute to the restoration of agricultural ecosystems, enhancing ecosystem services and biodiversity.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+;Promoting healthy and sustainable food systems can contribute to urban biodiversity conservation, as urban areas can provide habitat for various species and support ecosystem services.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5,TA6.26,TA6.9,TA7.21;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;-;Reducing pesticide use in forests can help protect forest ecosystems, but the impact of pesticide reduction on forest restoration is less direct compared to agricultural ecosystems.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;-;Promoting competitive agriculture might lead to increased pressure on marine ecosystems, particularly if agricultural practices contribute to pollution or habitat destruction in coastal areas.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;-;Ensuring food affordability might lead to increased fishing pressure, potentially harming marine biodiversity and ecosystems.
Food quality;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;Improving food quality through sustainable practices can contribute to biodiversity conservation, as sustainable agriculture and food systems can help maintain ecosystem services and promote species conservation.
