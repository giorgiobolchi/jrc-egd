Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;Food quality - Healthy Food;+;The development of rail freight and passenger transport can lead to reduced emissions and increased efficiency in food transportation, which can positively impact the quality and safety of food, particularly healthy food. This can also lead to increased accessibility and affordability of healthy food options.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.26;Food affordability;-;The transition to net-zero technology in road vehicles may lead to increased costs for farmers and food producers, which could negatively impact food prices and affordability, particularly for low-income households.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.7;Pesticides Reduction;+;The development and use of other low-carbon fuels can lead to reduced dependence on fossil fuels and decreased emissions, which can positively impact the reduction of pesticides and other harmful chemicals in agriculture.
Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Competitive Agriculture;+;The production and use of biofuels can create new opportunities for farmers and agricultural businesses, particularly in rural areas, which can positively impact the competitiveness of the agricultural sector.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;Food quality;+;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure can lead to increased efficiency and reduced emissions in food transportation and storage, which can positively impact food quality and safety.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;Food affordability;-;The shift towards urban mobility and reduced car dependency may lead to increased costs for food transportation and delivery, which could negatively impact food affordability, particularly for low-income households.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.50;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+;The development of sustainable transport logistics can lead to reduced emissions and increased efficiency in food transportation, which can positively impact animal welfare and reduce the risk of animal stress and injury during transportation.
