Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;GHG Reduction;+;The implementation of biofuels targets in List A can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which is a key objective of the GHG Reduction sub-theme in List B. This is because biofuels can replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions from transportation.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.30,TA4.31;GHG Reduction;+;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure in List A can support the use of hydrogen as a low-carbon fuel, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the GHG Reduction sub-theme in List B.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25;GHG Reduction;+;The promotion of net-zero technology in road vehicles in List A can help reduce emissions from transportation, which is a key sector for GHG Reduction in List B. This can contribute to the achievement of GHG reduction targets.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.4,TA4.5,TA4.6;GHG Reduction;+;The development and use of other low-carbon fuels in List A can provide alternative energy sources and help reduce dependence on fossil fuels, contributing to the GHG Reduction sub-theme in List B.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;GHG Reduction;+;The promotion of rail transportation in List A can help reduce emissions from transportation, as rail is generally a lower-carbon mode of transport compared to road or air. This can contribute to the GHG Reduction sub-theme in List B.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.39;GHG Reduction;+;The improvement of transport logistics in List A can help reduce emissions from transportation by optimizing routes and modes of transport, which can contribute to the GHG Reduction sub-theme in List B.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;GHG Reduction;+;The promotion of urban mobility in List A can help reduce emissions from transportation by encouraging the use of low-carbon modes of transport, such as walking, cycling, or public transport, which can contribute to the GHG Reduction sub-theme in List B.
