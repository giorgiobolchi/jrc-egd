Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;GHG Reduction;+;The implementation of renewable energy targets in the 'Renewable Energy' sub-theme can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, thereby positively impacting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme. This is because renewable energy sources like solar and wind power produce little to no emissions, reducing the overall carbon footprint.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3, TA2.40, TA4.1, TA4.20, TA4.21, TA4.22;GHG Reduction;+;The development of renewable hydrogen production can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme by providing a low-carbon alternative for energy and industrial processes.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17, TA2.22, TA2.23;GHG Reduction;+;Improving energy efficiency as outlined in the 'Energy Efficiency' sub-theme can lead to reduced energy consumption, which in turn decreases greenhouse gas emissions, positively impacting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20, TA2.21, TA2.24, TA2.25, TA2.26, TA2.27, TA2.28, TA2.29, TA2.30, TA2.31, TA2.32, TA2.33, TA2.34, TA2.35, TA2.36;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;The 'Energy Efficiency - Buildings' sub-theme aims to reduce energy consumption in buildings, which directly contributes to the 'GHG Reduction - Buildings' sub-theme by lowering emissions from the building sector.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5, TA2.6, TA2.7;GHG Reduction;+;The expansion of solar energy as outlined in the 'Renewable Energy - Solar' sub-theme can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with solar power, thus positively impacting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2, TA2.8;GHG Reduction;+;The 'Social Security - Energy' sub-theme, by ensuring access to affordable and clean energy for all, can indirectly support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of renewable energy sources over fossil fuels, thereby positively impacting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14, TA2.16, TA2.4;GHG Reduction;+;The 'Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling' sub-theme focuses on increasing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, which can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from these sectors, positively impacting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38, TA2.39;GHG Reduction;+;The development of offshore renewable energy as outlined in the 'Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore' sub-theme can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by providing additional low-carbon energy sources, thus positively impacting the 'GHG Reduction' sub-theme.
