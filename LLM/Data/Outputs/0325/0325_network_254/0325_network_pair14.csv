Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;Transport Logistics;-;The reduction of waste, particularly in the municipal and packaging sectors, can lead to a decrease in the amount of waste that needs to be transported, thereby reducing the environmental impact of transport logistics.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4;Urban Mobility;-;Effective waste reduction in municipal waste can lead to a decrease in the amount of waste that needs to be collected and transported, making urban mobility more efficient and reducing congestion.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+;The increased recycling of municipal waste can lead to the production of secondary raw materials, which can be used in the manufacturing of net-zero technology road vehicles, such as electric vehicles.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;-;The recycling of textile waste can lead to the production of new textile products, which may require more energy to produce, potentially increasing the demand for other low-carbon fuels.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Hydrogen Distribution;+;The secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials is essential for the production of hydrogen fuel cells and other hydrogen-related technologies, which can be used for energy storage and distribution.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Rail;+;The development of net-zero technology manufacturing can lead to the production of more efficient and sustainable rail systems, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable transportation.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;Biofuels;-;The reduction of plastic waste can lead to a decrease in the amount of plastic that can be converted into biofuels, potentially reducing the availability of this low-carbon fuel source.
