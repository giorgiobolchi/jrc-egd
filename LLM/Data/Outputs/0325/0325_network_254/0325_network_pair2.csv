GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in List A can positively influence the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles, as reducing GHG emissions requires the adoption of cleaner transportation methods. This synergy can lead to increased investment in electric vehicles and alternative fuels.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Biofuels;-;However, the focus on GHG reduction might lead to an increased demand for biofuels, which could have negative environmental impacts, such as land use changes and water pollution, affecting the development of sustainable biofuel technologies.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Urban Mobility;+;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can reduce the energy consumption of urban areas, making them more sustainable and livable, which in turn can promote urban mobility and reduce the need for personal vehicles.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Hydrogen Distribution;+;The development of GHG removal technologies can complement the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier, as it can utilize captured CO2 to produce hydrogen, creating a closed-loop system that minimizes emissions.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Transport Logistics;+;Reducing GHG emissions in the transportation sector can lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs in transport logistics, making it more competitive and sustainable.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA4.10,TA4.12,TA4.15,TA4.16,TA4.17;Rail;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in the transportation sector can promote the development of rail transportation, which is generally more energy-efficient and produces fewer emissions than road or air transport.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;-;However, the focus on climate resilience might lead to an increased reliance on other low-carbon fuels, which could have negative environmental impacts, such as air pollution and resource depletion, affecting the development of sustainable energy technologies.
