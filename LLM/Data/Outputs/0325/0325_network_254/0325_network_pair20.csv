Biofuels;TA4.1,TA4.18,TA4.7;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;The implementation of biofuels targets can lead to increased production of bio-based products, which can be recycled and contribute to a circular economy, thereby positively influencing municipal waste reduction. This connection is based on the report's emphasis on the role of bioeconomy in achieving a circular economy.
Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;TA4.13,TA4.22,TA4.25;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;The transition to net-zero technology in road vehicles can lead to a reduction in waste generated from vehicle production and disposal, contributing to municipal waste reduction. This connection is supported by the report's discussion on the importance of sustainable transportation and waste management.
Other Low-Carbon Fuels;TA4.5,TA4.6;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;The increased demand for critical raw materials required for other low-carbon fuels can lead to trade-offs with extraction and import targets, potentially negatively impacting the security and sustainability of critical raw material supplies. This connection is based on the report's analysis of the challenges associated with critical raw material extraction and import.
Hydrogen Distribution;TA4.23,TA4.31;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;The development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure can support the manufacturing of net-zero technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolysers, by providing a reliable and efficient supply of hydrogen. This connection is supported by the report's discussion on the role of hydrogen in achieving a net-zero economy.
Urban Mobility;TA4.54;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+;The promotion of sustainable urban mobility can lead to a reduction in plastic waste generated from transportation activities, such as packaging and single-use plastics, contributing to a circular economy. This connection is based on the report's emphasis on the importance of sustainable urban planning and waste reduction.
Transport Logistics;TA4.11,TA4.36,TA4.37;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;The optimization of transport logistics can help reduce food waste by improving the efficiency of food transportation and storage, thereby contributing to food waste reduction. This connection is supported by the report's discussion on the importance of sustainable food systems and waste reduction.
Rail;TA4.37,TA4.38,TA4.40;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;The development of rail transportation can lead to an increased demand for critical raw materials, such as lithium and cobalt, used in battery production, which can be recycled and contribute to a circular economy. This connection is based on the report's analysis of the importance of critical raw material recycling and the role of rail transportation in achieving a circular economy.
