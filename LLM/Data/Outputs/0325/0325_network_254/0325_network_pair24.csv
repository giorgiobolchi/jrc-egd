Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;GHG Reduction;+;The implementation of competitive agriculture targets, such as securing access to quality seeds and promoting sustainable agriculture, can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector, thereby supporting the GHG Reduction sub-theme. This is because sustainable agriculture practices can lead to improved soil health, increased carbon sequestration, and reduced synthetic fertilizer use.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;GHG Removal;-;However, the focus on competitive agriculture might also lead to increased land use and intensification of farming practices, potentially resulting in higher emissions and reduced carbon removal capacities, thus negatively impacting the GHG Removal sub-theme.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.35;GHG Reduction;+;Policies aimed at ensuring food affordability, such as reducing food waste and improving resource efficiency, can also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the food system, supporting the GHG Reduction sub-theme. By making food more affordable and reducing waste, the overall environmental impact of food production and consumption can be decreased.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.34;GHG Reduction;+;Promoting healthy and sustainable food options can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture and food sectors, as these options often involve more efficient and less resource-intensive production methods, thereby supporting the GHG Reduction sub-theme.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;GHG Reduction;+;Reducing pesticide use can lead to more sustainable agricultural practices, which in turn can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the GHG Reduction sub-theme. This is because sustainable agriculture practices often involve reduced synthetic fertilizer use and improved soil health, leading to increased carbon sequestration.
Food quality;TA5.30,TA5.32;GHG Reduction - Buildings;-;The focus on food quality might lead to increased energy consumption in buildings, such as in food processing and storage facilities, potentially resulting in higher emissions and negatively impacting the GHG Reduction - Buildings sub-theme.
