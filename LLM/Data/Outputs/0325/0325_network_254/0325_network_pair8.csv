Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;Net-Zero Technology - Road Vehicles;+;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which can positively impact the development of net-zero technology in road vehicles. This is because renewable energy can provide a cleaner source of power for electric vehicles.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40;Hydrogen Distribution;+;The production of renewable hydrogen can lead to an increase in the availability of hydrogen for distribution, which can positively impact the development of hydrogen distribution infrastructure. This is because a reliable supply of hydrogen is necessary for the widespread adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Urban Mobility;+;The improvement of energy efficiency in buildings can lead to a reduction in energy consumption, which can positively impact urban mobility by reducing the need for energy-intensive transportation modes. This is because energy-efficient buildings can reduce the demand for energy, making it easier to power electric vehicles and other low-carbon transportation modes.
Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.9;Other Low-Carbon Fuels;+;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which can positively impact the development of other low-carbon fuels. This is because renewable energy can provide a cleaner source of power for the production of low-carbon fuels.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Transport Logistics;-;The increased use of solar energy can lead to an increase in the demand for land, which can negatively impact transport logistics by reducing the availability of land for transportation infrastructure. This is because large solar farms can occupy significant amounts of land, potentially conflicting with transportation corridors.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Rail;+;The improvement of energy efficiency can lead to a reduction in energy consumption, which can positively impact the rail sector by reducing the need for energy-intensive rail transportation modes. This is because energy-efficient rail systems can reduce the demand for energy, making it easier to power electric trains and other low-carbon rail transportation modes.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40;Biofuels;-;The production of renewable hydrogen can lead to an increase in the competition for biomass resources, which can negatively impact the production of biofuels. This is because biomass is a key feedstock for both hydrogen production and biofuel production, and increased demand for biomass can drive up costs and reduce availability.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Urban Mobility;+;The improvement of social security in the energy sector can lead to an increase in the availability of energy-related services, which can positively impact urban mobility by providing low-income households with access to affordable energy for transportation. This is because energy poverty can limit access to transportation modes, and social security programs can help alleviate this issue.
