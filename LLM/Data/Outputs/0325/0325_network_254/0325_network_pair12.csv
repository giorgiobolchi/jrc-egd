Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.5,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;GHG Reduction;+;Reducing waste can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration release methane and other GHGs, and reducing waste can reduce the need for these practices.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.5;GHG Reduction;+;Municipal waste reduction targets can help decrease GHG emissions from waste management, as municipal waste is a significant source of methane emissions.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46;GHG Reduction;+;Reducing food waste can lower GHG emissions from agricultural production, transportation, and storage, as well as from waste management practices.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;GHG Reduction;+;Reducing plastic and packaging waste can decrease GHG emissions from production, transportation, and waste management of these materials.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;GHG Reduction;+;Increasing circularity and recycling rates can reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the need for primary materials extraction, processing, and transportation.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;GHG Reduction;+;Improving municipal waste recycling rates can lower GHG emissions from waste management and production of new materials.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;GHG Reduction;+;Reducing textile waste and increasing recycling rates can decrease GHG emissions from textile production and waste management.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;GHG Reduction;+;Responsible extraction and import of critical raw materials can reduce GHG emissions from production and transportation of these materials.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;GHG Reduction;+;Developing and manufacturing net-zero technologies can reduce GHG emissions from various sectors, including energy, transportation, and industry.
Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.5,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;GHG Removal;-;While reducing waste can lead to a decrease in GHG emissions, it may also limit the availability of organic waste for carbon removal technologies such as carbon capture and storage or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.5;GHG Removal;-;Municipal waste reduction targets may reduce the amount of organic waste available for carbon removal technologies, potentially limiting their effectiveness.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;GHG Removal;-;Increasing circularity and recycling rates may reduce the availability of organic waste for carbon removal technologies, potentially limiting their effectiveness.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Climate Resilience;+;Responsible extraction and import of critical raw materials can support the development of climate-resilient technologies and infrastructure.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Climate Resilience;+;Developing and manufacturing net-zero technologies can support climate resilience by reducing GHG emissions and promoting a low-carbon economy.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37;GHG Reduction - Buildings;-;Reducing plastic and packaging waste may not have a direct impact on GHG emissions from buildings, as buildings are not a significant source of plastic and packaging waste.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;GHG Reduction - Transports;-;Improving municipal waste recycling rates may not have a direct impact on GHG emissions from transportation, as transportation is not a significant source of municipal waste.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;GHG Reduction - Buildings;-;Reducing textile waste and increasing recycling rates may not have a direct impact on GHG emissions from buildings, as textile production is not a significant source of GHG emissions from buildings.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;Responsible extraction and import of critical raw materials can support the development of low-carbon transportation technologies and infrastructure.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;Developing and manufacturing net-zero technologies can support the transition to low-carbon transportation, reducing GHG emissions from the sector.
