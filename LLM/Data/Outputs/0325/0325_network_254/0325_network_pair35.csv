Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Improve Air Quality;+;Restoring forests can help improve air quality by removing pollutants and particulate matter from the air, thus contributing to the improvement of air quality. This is in line with the EU's goal to reduce air pollution and promote a healthy environment.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Improve Soils Health;+;Restoring agricultural ecosystems can help improve soil health by promoting sustainable farming practices, reducing soil erosion, and increasing soil organic matter, which are all crucial for maintaining healthy soils and mitigating soil degradation.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15, TA6.1, TA6.14, TA6.17, TA6.3, TA6.43, TA6.5;Improve Water Quality;+;Protecting and restoring natural habitats, such as wetlands and rivers, can help improve water quality by filtering out pollutants and sediments, thus contributing to the improvement of water quality and the overall health of aquatic ecosystems.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13, TA6.42;Improve Water Quality;+;Restoring rivers and their ecosystems can help improve water quality by removing pollutants, sediments, and excess nutrients, thus contributing to the improvement of water quality and the overall health of aquatic ecosystems.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2, TA6.33, TA6.44, TA6.45;Improve Water Quality;+;Restoring marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs and seaweed beds, can help improve water quality by removing pollutants and excess nutrients, thus contributing to the improvement of water quality and the overall health of marine ecosystems.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16, TA6.39, TA6.40, TA6.41;Improve Air Quality;+;Urban nature restoration can help improve air quality by increasing green spaces, which absorb pollutants and particulate matter, thus contributing to the improvement of air quality and the overall health of urban ecosystems.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6, TA6.18, TA6.27, TA6.28;Improve Water Quality;+;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices can help improve water quality by reducing pollution from fishing gear and aquaculture activities, thus contributing to the improvement of water quality and the overall health of marine ecosystems.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.21, TA6.21, TA6.32, TA6.34, TA6.35, TA6.36, TA6.38, TA6.63, TA6.7;Improve Soils Health;+;Restoring terrestrial ecosystems can help improve soil health by promoting sustainable land use practices, reducing soil erosion, and increasing soil organic matter, which are all crucial for maintaining healthy soils and mitigating soil degradation.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37, TA6.46;Improve Air Quality;+;Monitoring biodiversity can help identify areas where air quality is poor and inform restoration efforts to improve air quality, thus contributing to the improvement of air quality and the overall health of ecosystems.
