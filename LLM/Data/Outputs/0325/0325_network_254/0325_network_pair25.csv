Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Renewable Energy;+;The implementation of competitive agriculture targets can lead to increased demand for renewable energy, as agricultural activities may require more energy for operations, thus potentially driving the growth of the renewable energy sector.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Energy Efficiency;+;Competitive agriculture targets may also promote energy-efficient practices in agricultural operations, which can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of the sector, aligning with energy efficiency targets.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Renewable Energy;+;Increased food affordability can lead to higher demand for energy, potentially driving the adoption of renewable energy sources to meet this demand, thus supporting the growth of the renewable energy sector.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Energy Efficiency;+;Policies aimed at improving food affordability may also encourage energy-efficient practices in food production, processing, and distribution, contributing to the achievement of energy efficiency targets.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Renewable Energy;+;Reducing pesticide use can lead to more sustainable agricultural practices, potentially increasing the availability of biomass for renewable energy production, thus supporting the renewable energy sector.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Energy Efficiency;+;Sustainable agricultural practices resulting from pesticide reduction targets can also lead to more energy-efficient farming operations, aligning with energy efficiency objectives.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Renewable Energy;-;Promoting healthy food options might lead to changes in dietary habits, potentially reducing energy demand if consumers opt for locally sourced or less energy-intensive food products, which could negatively impact the demand for renewable energy.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29,TA5.31,TA5.32,TA5.33,TA5.34;Energy Efficiency;+;Healthy food initiatives may also encourage sustainable food systems, including energy-efficient food production and distribution, thus supporting energy efficiency targets.
