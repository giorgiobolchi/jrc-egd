Improve Air Quality;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.47;Renewable Energy;+;Improving air quality through the reduction of pollutants can increase the efficiency of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels, and enhance their overall performance.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7,TA7.14,TA7.15;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;The production of renewable energy from hydrogen may require significant amounts of water, potentially competing with other uses and impacting water quality.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Energy Efficiency;-;Improving soil health can lead to increased energy demand for agricultural practices, potentially offsetting energy efficiency gains in other sectors.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;-;The development of offshore renewable energy infrastructure may generate noise pollution, negatively impacting marine ecosystems and human health.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;Social Security - Energy;+;Improved sanitation and access to clean energy can have synergistic effects on public health, particularly for vulnerable populations, by reducing the burden of waterborne and respiratory diseases.
Improve Water Quality;TA7.1,TA7.7,TA7.14,TA7.15;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;Reducing water pollution can decrease the energy required for water treatment, leading to increased energy efficiency in buildings and industrial processes.
Improve Air Quality;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.47;Energy Efficiency;-;While improving air quality can have numerous health and environmental benefits, it may also lead to increased energy consumption in certain sectors, such as transportation and industry, potentially offsetting energy efficiency gains.
