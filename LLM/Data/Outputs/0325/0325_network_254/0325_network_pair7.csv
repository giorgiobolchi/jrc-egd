Renewable Energy;TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;The increased use of renewable energy can lead to a reduction in waste generated from fossil fuel-based energy production, which in turn can reduce municipal waste. This connection is based on the report's emphasis on the importance of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.40;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;-;The production of renewable hydrogen may require the extraction of critical raw materials, which can have negative environmental and social impacts. This connection is based on the report's discussion of the potential risks associated with the extraction of critical raw materials.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Circularity/Recycling;+;Improving energy efficiency can lead to a reduction in energy consumption, which can in turn reduce the demand for raw materials and promote circularity and recycling. This connection is based on the report's emphasis on the importance of energy efficiency in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.18,TA2.32;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;Improving energy efficiency in buildings can lead to a reduction in waste generated from construction and demolition activities, which can reduce municipal waste. This connection is based on the report's discussion of the potential benefits of improving energy efficiency in buildings.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;The increased use of solar energy can lead to an increased demand for batteries, which can promote the development of circular economy practices and recycling of critical raw materials. This connection is based on the report's emphasis on the importance of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;-;The implementation of social security measures related to energy may not have a direct impact on food waste reduction, but it can have an indirect negative impact by increasing energy consumption and potentially leading to increased food waste. This connection is based on the report's discussion of the potential risks associated with increased energy consumption.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;Improving energy efficiency can lead to a reduction in energy consumption, which can in turn promote the development of net-zero technology and manufacturing. This connection is based on the report's emphasis on the importance of energy efficiency in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.
