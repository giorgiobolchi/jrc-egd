Renewable Energy;TA2.1,TA2.3,TA2.10,TA2.11,TA2.12,TA2.15,TA2.19,TA2.37,TA2.40,TA2.41;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+;The implementation of renewable energy targets can lead to the preservation and restoration of natural ecosystems, as renewable energy sources like solar and wind power require large areas of land, which can be used to restore degraded ecosystems and promote biodiversity.
Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;TA2.4,TA2.40;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;Hydrogen production from renewable energy sources can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable land use, which can have a positive impact on biodiversity conservation and protection.
Energy Efficiency;TA2.17,TA2.22,TA2.23;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-;The implementation of energy efficiency targets in the agricultural sector can lead to increased use of resources and land, potentially competing with restoration efforts and having a negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems.
Energy Efficiency - Buildings;TA2.20,TA2.21,TA2.24,TA2.25,TA2.26,TA2.27,TA2.28,TA2.29,TA2.30,TA2.31,TA2.33,TA2.34,TA2.35,TA2.36;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+;Energy-efficient buildings can help reduce urban pollution and promote sustainable urban planning, which can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity and nature conservation.
Social Security - Energy;TA2.2,TA2.8;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;-;The implementation of social security measures for energy can lead to increased energy consumption and potentially negative impacts on biodiversity, particularly if energy sources are not sustainable.
Renewable Energy - Solar;TA2.5,TA2.6,TA2.7,TA2.9;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;+;Solar energy can help reduce deforestation and promote sustainable land use, which can have a positive impact on forest ecosystems and biodiversity conservation.
Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;TA2.38,TA2.39;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+;Offshore renewable energy can help promote marine ecosystem restoration and conservation, particularly in areas with high biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Renewable Energy - Heating & Cooling;TA2.14,TA2.16,TA2.4;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;-;The implementation of renewable energy targets for heating and cooling can lead to increased use of biomass and land, potentially competing with restoration efforts and having a negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems.
