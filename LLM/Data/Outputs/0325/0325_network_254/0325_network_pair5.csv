GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13;Improve Air Quality;+;Reducing GHG emissions can lead to improved air quality, as many GHG-emitting activities also release air pollutants. This connection is supported by Report n°2, which highlights the importance of addressing both climate change and air pollution.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13;Improve Water Quality;+;GHG reduction efforts, such as increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy use, can also reduce water pollution from energy production and industrial activities. Report n°2 emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to environmental protection.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Improve Air Quality;+;Improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing their GHG emissions can also decrease air pollution from heating and cooling systems. This connection is relevant to Report n°2's discussion on building renovation and energy efficiency.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Improve Soils Health;+;GHG removal strategies, such as afforestation and soil carbon sequestration, can improve soil health and fertility. Report n°2 highlights the importance of soil conservation and restoration for achieving climate and environmental goals.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Improve Water Quality;+;Enhancing climate resilience can involve measures to protect and restore water resources, which in turn can improve water quality. Report n°2 discusses the need for climate-resilient infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaptation.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.14;Improve Air Quality;+;Reducing GHG emissions from transportation can also decrease air pollution from vehicles, improving air quality. Report n°2 emphasizes the importance of sustainable transportation and reducing emissions from the transport sector.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13;Noise Reduction;-;While GHG reduction efforts are crucial, some measures like increasing wind energy production can lead to noise pollution, potentially negatively impacting noise reduction goals. Report n°2 does not directly address this trade-off, but it is an important consideration in the context of renewable energy development.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Social Security - Sanitation;+;GHG removal strategies, such as sustainable land use and ecosystem restoration, can also improve sanitation and public health by reducing the spread of diseases. Report n°2 discusses the interconnectedness of environmental and social challenges.
