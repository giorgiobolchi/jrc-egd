Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Air Quality;+;Reducing municipal waste can lead to a decrease in air pollution from waste management activities, thus improving air quality. Effective waste management strategies can also reduce the production of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47,TA3.5;Improve Water Quality;+;Proper management of municipal waste can prevent pollution of water bodies, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases and improving overall water quality. This is achieved through the implementation of waste reduction targets and improved waste management practices.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Improve Air Quality;+;Increasing recycling rates and adopting circular economy practices in municipal waste management can reduce air pollution from waste incineration and landfilling, contributing to improved air quality. This is in line with the European Green Deal's objectives.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4,TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Improve Water Quality;-;The production and disposal of textile waste can lead to water pollution through the release of microplastics and chemicals. While recycling textile waste is beneficial, the extraction and processing of raw materials for new textiles can still harm water quality, highlighting the need for sustainable textile production practices.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Improve Soils Health;-;The extraction of critical raw materials can result in soil degradation and pollution, negatively impacting soil health. This is particularly concerning in areas with fragile ecosystems, where mining activities can have long-lasting effects on the environment.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Improve Air Quality;+;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies, such as renewable energy systems and energy-efficient appliances, can significantly reduce air pollution from industrial activities, contributing to improved air quality and a cleaner environment.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46,TA5.13,TA6.26;Improve Soils Health;+;Reducing food waste can decrease the environmental impacts associated with food production, including soil degradation and nutrient depletion. This can lead to improved soil health and increased agricultural productivity.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37,TA3.39,TA3.40;Improve Water Quality;+;Decreasing plastic waste and improving packaging sustainability can reduce marine pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems, ultimately contributing to improved water quality and a healthier environment.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Improve Soils Health;+;Recycling critical raw materials from batteries can reduce the need for primary extraction, minimizing soil degradation and pollution associated with mining activities. This promotes more sustainable use of resources and reduces environmental impacts.
