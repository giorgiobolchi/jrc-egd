Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;+;Improving air quality can lead to increased recycling rates and proper waste management, which in turn can reduce waste sent to landfills and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This connection is based on the idea that better air quality can facilitate more efficient recycling processes.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1, TA7.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;-;Improving water quality may lead to increased costs for wastewater treatment, which could negatively impact municipal waste reduction efforts if not managed properly. This connection is grounded in the report's emphasis on the need for sustainable and efficient waste management practices.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3, TA6.12, TA6.15, TA6.49, TA7.10, TA7.12, TA7.19, TA7.20;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;Enhancing soil health can lead to increased efficiency in critical raw material extraction and recycling, such as those used in batteries. This is because healthier soils can support more sustainable and resilient ecosystems, which in turn can contribute to more effective recycling practices.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;-;Noise reduction targets might conflict with the manufacturing requirements for net-zero technologies, potentially leading to trade-offs between these two goals. This connection is based on the understanding that manufacturing processes can sometimes generate significant noise, which might need to be balanced against noise reduction targets.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1, TA7.3;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Improving sanitation can lead to better management of food waste, reducing the amount of waste generated and supporting more circular economy practices. This connection is rooted in the report's discussion on the importance of proper waste management for achieving circular economy goals.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8, TA7.1, TA7.7;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;+;Enhanced water quality can facilitate more effective recycling of plastics and packaging materials, reducing marine pollution and supporting a more circular economy. This connection is grounded in the report's emphasis on the need for sustainable practices to protect water resources and reduce pollution.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3, TA6.12, TA6.15, TA6.49, TA7.10, TA7.12, TA7.19, TA7.20;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+;Healthy soils can support more sustainable extraction and use of critical raw materials, reducing the environmental impact of these processes. This connection is based on the understanding that soil health is crucial for supporting ecosystem services, including those related to raw material extraction and use.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;-;Stricter air quality standards might increase the cost of recycling certain types of plastic and packaging, potentially making it more challenging to achieve waste reduction targets. This connection is rooted in the report's discussion on the complexities of balancing different environmental goals, such as air quality and waste reduction.
