Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;GHG Reduction;+;Improving air quality can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as air pollution is often linked to fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities that release GHGs. By reducing air pollution, we can also reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14;GHG Reduction;+;Water pollution can be linked to energy production and industrial processes that release GHGs. By improving water quality, we can reduce the energy needed for water treatment and thereby decrease GHG emissions.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Removal;+;Soil health is crucial for carbon sequestration, and improving soil health can lead to increased carbon removal from the atmosphere. Healthy soils can act as a carbon sink, mitigating climate change.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;GHG Reduction - Transports;-;Noise reduction measures in the transport sector might lead to increased fuel efficiency, but they could also lead to increased travel speeds, potentially resulting in higher emissions. However, the overall impact is likely to be small compared to other factors.
Social Security - Sanitation;TA7.1,TA7.3;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;Improved sanitation can lead to more efficient use of resources, including energy and water, in buildings. This can result in reduced GHG emissions from buildings, contributing to a decrease in overall emissions.
Improve Water Quality;TA5.8,TA7.1,TA7.14;GHG Reduction - Buildings;+;Water-efficient measures in buildings can reduce the energy needed for water heating and treatment, leading to lower GHG emissions. Additionally, reducing water pollution can decrease the energy required for water treatment, further reducing emissions.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;Climate Resilience;+;Healthy soils are essential for climate resilience, as they can help mitigate the effects of climate change by storing carbon, filtering water, and supporting biodiversity. Improving soil health can enhance the ability of ecosystems to adapt to climate change.
Improve Air Quality;TA4.47,TA7.13,TA7.16,TA7.22,TA7.5;GHG Reduction - Transports;+;Improving air quality can lead to increased use of cleaner transportation modes, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, which can reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector.
Noise Reduction;TA7.17;GHG Reduction;-;While noise reduction measures might lead to some efficiency gains, they could also result in increased travel speeds or more frequent travel, potentially offsetting any emissions reductions. The impact of noise reduction on GHG emissions is complex and dependent on various factors.
Improve Soils Health;TA5.3,TA6.12,TA6.15,TA6.49,TA7.10,TA7.12,TA7.19,TA7.20;GHG Reduction;-;Soil health improvement might require increased use of fertilizers or machinery, potentially leading to higher emissions. However, this impact is likely to be small compared to the overall benefits of improved soil health for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.
