Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;GHG Reduction;+;The protection and restoration of natural ecosystems, such as forests and wetlands, can help sequester carbon dioxide and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby contributing to the GHG reduction targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;GHG Removal;+;The restoration of forests can enhance carbon sequestration, which is a key strategy for GHG removal, and can also support the development of sustainable forest management practices that prioritize carbon storage.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Climate Resilience;+;Urban nature-based solutions, such as green roofs and urban forests, can help mitigate the urban heat island effect, reduce flood risk, and improve air quality, thereby enhancing climate resilience in urban areas.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;GHG Reduction;+;The restoration of marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs and mangroves, can help sequester carbon dioxide and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby contributing to the GHG reduction targets.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;GHG Reduction;+;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can help sequester carbon dioxide and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through practices such as agroforestry and permaculture, thereby contributing to the GHG reduction targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62;GHG Removal;-;The protection and restoration of natural ecosystems can also lead to the release of stored carbon, potentially offsetting GHG removal efforts, highlighting the need for careful management and consideration of ecosystem dynamics.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Climate Resilience;+;The restoration of river ecosystems can help improve water quality, reduce flood risk, and enhance ecosystem resilience, thereby contributing to climate resilience and supporting the achievement of climate-related targets.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;GHG Reduction;+;Sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices can help reduce the carbon footprint of the fishing industry, thereby contributing to the GHG reduction targets, and can also support the development of low-carbon fishing technologies and practices.
