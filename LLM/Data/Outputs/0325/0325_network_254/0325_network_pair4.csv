GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;+;Reducing GHG emissions can have a positive impact on biodiversity protection and conservation by mitigating climate change, which is a key driver of biodiversity loss. This can help preserve ecosystems and species, ultimately supporting biodiversity conservation.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;+;GHG reduction efforts can contribute to the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems by promoting sustainable land use practices, reducing deforestation, and encouraging reforestation, which can help sequester carbon and support ecosystem services.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;-;The focus on reducing GHG emissions from buildings might lead to an increased demand for wood and other forest products, potentially threatening forest ecosystems and undermining restoration efforts if not managed sustainably.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Marine Ecosystem Restoration;+;GHG removal strategies, such as ocean fertilization or blue carbon initiatives, can directly contribute to the restoration of marine ecosystems by enhancing carbon sequestration and supporting marine biodiversity.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;+;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on fisheries and marine ecosystems, supporting the conservation of marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fishing practices.
Climate Resilience;TA1.1,TA1.4;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;+;Enhancing climate resilience can support the restoration of agricultural ecosystems by promoting practices that improve soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, making these systems more resilient to climate change.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.14;Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;-;The transition to low-carbon transportation systems might lead to an increased focus on riverine transport, potentially disrupting river ecosystems and affecting restoration efforts if not properly managed.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;+;GHG removal strategies can support biodiversity conservation by reducing the pressure of climate change on ecosystems, allowing for more effective monitoring and conservation of biodiversity.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13;Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;+;Reducing GHG emissions can help mitigate the urban heat island effect and improve air quality, supporting urban biodiversity and ecosystem services, and enhancing the quality of life in urban areas.
