Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;Increasing recycling rates and reducing waste sent to landfills can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn can support the growth of renewable energy sources like solar. This is because reducing waste can decrease the amount of energy needed for waste management, allowing more resources to be allocated to renewable energy production.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;Improving waste management through recycling and reduction can lead to more efficient use of resources, including energy, in buildings. This is because reducing waste can decrease the amount of energy needed for waste management, allowing more resources to be allocated to energy-efficient building practices.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;Increasing recycling rates and reducing waste sent to landfills can lead to a reduction in the availability of feedstocks for hydrogen production, potentially hindering the growth of this renewable energy source. This is because hydrogen production often relies on waste materials as feedstocks, and reducing waste can limit the availability of these materials.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11;Renewable Energy;+;Securing a stable supply of critical raw materials is crucial for the production of renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels. This is because these technologies rely on critical raw materials, and a stable supply can support the growth of the renewable energy sector.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA2.1,TA2.3;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;Developing net-zero technology manufacturing can lead to the production of more energy-efficient buildings and materials, supporting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. This is because net-zero technology manufacturing can produce materials and systems that are designed to be highly energy-efficient, reducing the energy needs of buildings.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25;Renewable Energy - Biogas;+;Reducing food waste can lead to an increase in the availability of organic materials for biogas production, supporting the growth of this renewable energy source. This is because biogas production relies on organic materials as feedstocks, and reducing food waste can increase the availability of these materials.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.4;Renewable Energy - Solar;-;Increasing recycling rates of textile waste can lead to a reduction in the availability of materials for the production of solar panels, potentially hindering the growth of this renewable energy source. This is because some solar panel materials, such as polyester, can be produced from recycled textile waste, and reducing textile waste can limit the availability of these materials.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling rates can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the growth of renewable energy sources like solar. This is because reducing plastic waste can decrease the amount of energy needed for waste management, allowing more resources to be allocated to renewable energy production.
Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;TA3.15,TA3.16;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;Increasing recycling rates of critical raw materials, such as those used in batteries, can lead to a reduction in the demand for primary materials, supporting the growth of renewable energy sources like hydrogen production. This is because hydrogen production often relies on critical raw materials, and reducing the demand for primary materials can support the development of more sustainable production methods.
