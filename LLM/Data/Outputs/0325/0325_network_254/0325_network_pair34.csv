Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Food quality;+;The implementation of biodiversity protection and conservation targets can lead to improved ecosystem services, including pollination and pest control, which can positively impact food quality by reducing the need for pesticides and improving crop yields.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.5,TA6.58,TA6.62,TA6.8;Food affordability;-;The conservation of biodiversity can lead to restrictions on land use and resource extraction, potentially increasing food prices and reducing affordability, particularly for low-income households.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Pesticides Reduction;+;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can lead to improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased biodiversity, which can reduce the need for pesticides and promote more sustainable agricultural practices.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Food quality;+;The restoration of forests can lead to improved ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, air and water filtration, and soil conservation, which can positively impact food quality by reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Food quality - Healthy Food;+;The restoration of marine ecosystems can lead to improved fisheries management, reduced pollution, and increased biodiversity, which can positively impact the quality and safety of seafood and promote healthier food options.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Food affordability;-;The conservation of fisheries and marine biodiversity can lead to restrictions on fishing practices and quotas, potentially reducing the availability and increasing the cost of seafood, which can negatively impact food affordability, particularly for low-income households.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Food quality;+;The conservation of urban nature and green spaces can lead to improved air and water quality, reduced urban heat islands, and increased biodiversity, which can positively impact food quality by reducing the environmental impacts of urban agriculture and promoting more sustainable food systems.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.21,TA6.32,TA6.34,TA6.35,TA6.36,TA6.38,TA6.63,TA6.7;Competitive Agriculture;+;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can lead to improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased biodiversity, which can promote more sustainable and competitive agricultural practices, improving crop yields and reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.
