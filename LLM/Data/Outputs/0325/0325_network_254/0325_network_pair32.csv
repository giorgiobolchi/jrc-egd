Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.11,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.58,TA6.62;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased waste reduction in municipal areas, as restored ecosystems can help absorb and process waste, reducing the need for landfill and incineration. This synergy can be seen in the targets of TA6.11, which aims to plant three billion trees, and TA6.14, which aims to reduce the environmental and climate footprint of EU cities.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;-;The restoration of agricultural ecosystems can lead to increased waste generation in municipal areas, as the use of organic farming methods and reduction of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides can result in increased waste from agricultural activities. This trade-off can be seen in the targets of TA5.9, which aims to increase organic farming, and TA6.10, which aims to have at least 10% of agricultural area under high-diversity landscape features.

Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+;The restoration of forests can lead to increased availability of critical raw materials, such as timber and biomass, which can reduce the need for extraction and import of these materials. This synergy can be seen in the targets of TA6.11, which aims to plant three billion trees, and TA6.4, which aims to strictly protect all remaining EU primary and old-growth forests.

Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;+;The restoration of marine ecosystems can lead to reduced plastic pollution in the ocean, as restored ecosystems can help absorb and process plastic waste. This synergy can be seen in the targets of TA6.2, which aims to legally protect at least 30% of the EU's sea area, and TA6.33, which aims to establish effective and sustainable management of marine protected areas.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15,TA6.1,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.3,TA6.43,TA6.58,TA6.62;Circularity/Recycling;-;The protection and conservation of biodiversity can lead to increased costs and complexity in recycling and waste management, as the use of certain materials and practices may harm biodiversity. This trade-off can be seen in the targets of TA5.11, which aims to protect the environment and restore natural habitats, and TA6.1, which aims to legally protect at least 30% of the EU's land area.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;-;The protection and conservation of biodiversity in fisheries can lead to reduced food waste, as sustainable fishing practices can help reduce bycatch and discarding of fish. This synergy can be seen in the targets of TA5.6, which aims to increase sustainable fishing and aquaculture, and TA6.18, which aims to eliminate or reduce bycatch of species.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Monitoring;TA6.37,TA6.46;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;The monitoring of biodiversity can lead to increased efficiency in the recycling of critical raw materials, such as those used in batteries, as monitoring can help identify areas where materials can be recovered and recycled. This synergy can be seen in the targets of TA6.37, which aims to ensure that the condition of ecosystems is maintained or restored, and TA6.46, which aims to ensure that the use of resources is sustainable and efficient.

Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;The protection and conservation of urban nature can lead to increased waste reduction in municipal areas, as urban ecosystems can help absorb and process waste, reducing the need for landfill and incineration. This synergy can be seen in the targets of TA6.16, which aims to have cities with at least 20,000 inhabitants have an urban green infrastructure, and TA6.39, which aims to ensure that there is no net loss of urban ecosystems.
