GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;The reduction of GHG emissions can lead to a decrease in waste production, as seen in the target TA1.13, which aims to reduce GHG emissions from waste management. This can positively impact waste reduction efforts, particularly in municipal waste.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Circularity/Recycling;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets can promote the adoption of circular economy practices, such as recycling and reuse, which can reduce waste and GHG emissions. This can have a positive impact on circularity and recycling efforts.
GHG Reduction - Buildings;TA1.15;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;-;The focus on reducing GHG emissions from buildings might lead to increased construction and demolition waste, potentially negatively impacting municipal waste reduction efforts.
GHG Removal;TA1.12;Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;+;The development of GHG removal technologies can lead to an increased demand for critical raw materials, such as those used in carbon capture and storage. This can have a positive impact on the extraction and import of these materials.
GHG Reduction;TA1.3,TA1.7,TA1.9,TA1.11,TA1.13,TA5.7;Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;+;The reduction of GHG emissions can drive the development and adoption of net-zero technologies, such as carbon-neutral manufacturing processes. This can have a positive impact on the manufacturing sector and its transition to net-zero emissions.
GHG Reduction - Transports;TA1.10,TA1.14;Circularity/Recycling - Vehicle Circularity;+;The implementation of GHG reduction targets in the transport sector can promote the adoption of circular economy practices, such as vehicle sharing and recycling, which can reduce waste and GHG emissions. This can have a positive impact on vehicle circularity efforts.
