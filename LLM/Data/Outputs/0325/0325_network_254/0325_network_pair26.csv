Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;The implementation of competitive agriculture targets, such as securing access to quality food and fostering the competitiveness of the EU supply chain, can positively influence waste reduction in food waste by promoting efficient food production and distribution systems.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20,TA5.21,TA5.23;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;-;However, the focus on competitive agriculture might lead to increased food production, potentially resulting in more waste generation, which could negatively impact municipal waste management and circularity efforts.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Ensuring affordable food for all can reduce food waste by encouraging the consumption of available food products, thereby decreasing the amount of waste generated throughout the food supply chain.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.35;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;-;On the other hand, affordable food might lead to increased packaging waste, as cheaper food options often come with more packaging, potentially hindering efforts to reduce plastic and packaging waste.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;+;Reducing pesticide use can lead to healthier soils and decreased contamination of water and air, ultimately contributing to more effective waste management and circularity in municipal waste.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Circularity/Recycling - Critical Raw Materials - Batteries Recycling;+;Moreover, decreased pesticide use can promote the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices, potentially increasing the availability of organic materials for recycling and reuse in applications like battery production.
Food quality;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29;Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;-;Stricter food quality standards might result in more food waste due to higher rejection rates of non-compliant products, which could negatively impact municipal waste management and circularity.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Improving animal welfare in food production can lead to more efficient and sustainable farming practices, potentially reducing food waste by promoting better animal health and reducing the need for resource-intensive farming methods.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29;Waste Reduction - Food Waste;+;Similarly, promoting healthy food options can encourage the consumption of locally sourced, seasonal products, reducing transportation-related waste and supporting more efficient food distribution systems.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28,TA5.29;Circularity/Recycling - Plastic & Packaging;-;However, the focus on healthy food might lead to increased demand for packaged products with health-related claims, potentially resulting in more packaging waste and hindering circularity efforts in plastic and packaging.
