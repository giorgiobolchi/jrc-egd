Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration;TA6.1,TA6.3,TA6.14,TA6.17,TA6.43,TA6.62,TA6.8;Renewable Energy;+;The restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased carbon sequestration, which can support the transition to renewable energy sources by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thereby making renewable energy sources more viable.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Energy Efficiency;+;Sustainable agricultural practices can lead to increased energy efficiency in agriculture, reducing the energy required for farming and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Forests;TA6.11,TA6.4,TA6.50,TA6.51,TA6.52,TA6.59;Renewable Energy - Solar;+;The restoration of forests can lead to increased biomass production, which can be used to produce bioenergy, supporting the transition to renewable energy sources like solar power.
Marine Ecosystem Restoration;TA6.2,TA6.33,TA6.44,TA6.45;Renewable Energy - Ocean/Offshore;+;The restoration of marine ecosystems can lead to increased biodiversity and ecosystem services, supporting the development of offshore renewable energy sources like wind and tidal power.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation;TA5.11,TA5.15, TA6.1, TA6.14, TA6.17, TA6.3, TA6.43, TA6.5, TA6.62, TA6.8;Renewable Energy;+;The protection and conservation of biodiversity can support the development of renewable energy sources by preserving ecosystems that provide essential services like carbon sequestration and air and water purification.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Fisheries;TA5.6,TA6.18,TA6.27,TA6.28;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;-;The protection of fisheries can lead to reduced fishing activities, which may increase the cost of producing hydrogen from algae or other aquatic biomass, potentially hindering the development of renewable energy sources like hydrogen production.
Biodiversity Protection & Conservation - Urban Nature;TA6.16,TA6.39,TA6.40,TA6.41;Energy Efficiency - Buildings;+;The protection and conservation of urban nature can lead to increased energy efficiency in buildings by providing shading, cooling, and insulation, reducing the energy required for heating and cooling.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Rivers;TA6.13,TA6.42;Renewable Energy - Hydrogen Production;+;The restoration of rivers can lead to increased water availability and quality, supporting the production of hydrogen from water, a renewable energy source.
Terrestrial Ecosystems Restoration - Agricultural Ecosystems;TA5.9,TA6.10,TA6.47,TA6.48;Social Security - Energy;+;Sustainable agricultural practices can lead to increased energy security by promoting the use of local and renewable energy sources, reducing dependence on external energy supplies and supporting social security.
