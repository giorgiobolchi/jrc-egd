Waste Reduction;TA3.1,TA3.2,TA3.4,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45,TA3.47;Food quality;+;The reduction of waste, particularly food waste, can lead to improved food quality by reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and conserving natural resources. This, in turn, can contribute to a more sustainable food system.
Waste Reduction - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23,TA3.41,TA3.42,TA3.43,TA3.44,TA3.45;Food quality - Animal Welfare;+;The proper management of municipal waste can help reduce the environmental impact of animal farming, which can lead to improved animal welfare. For example, reducing waste can help minimize the risk of pollution and conserve natural resources.
Waste Reduction - Food Waste;TA3.24,TA3.25,TA3.46,TA5.13;Food affordability;+;Reducing food waste can help make food more affordable by reducing the amount of food that is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain. This can lead to lower food prices and improved food security.
Waste Reduction - Plastic & Packaging;TA3.27,TA3.28,TA3.31,TA3.32,TA3.33,TA3.34,TA3.35,TA3.36,TA3.37,TA3.39,TA3.40;Food quality - Healthy Food;+;The reduction of plastic waste in packaging can lead to improved food quality by reducing the risk of plastic contamination and conserving natural resources. This can contribute to a healthier food system.
Circularity/Recycling;TA3.3;Competitive Agriculture;+;The promotion of circularity and recycling can lead to improved competitiveness in agriculture by reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and promoting sustainable practices. This can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable agricultural sector.
Circularity/Recycling - Municipal Waste;TA3.20,TA3.21,TA3.22,TA3.23;Food quality;+;The recycling of municipal waste can help reduce the environmental impact of food production, which can lead to improved food quality. For example, recycling organic waste can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve natural resources.
Circularity/Recycling - Textile Waste;TA3.15,TA3.16,TA3.17,TA3.18,TA3.19;Pesticides Reduction;-;The recycling of textile waste may lead to increased use of pesticides in textile production, which can negatively impact the environment and human health. This can undermine efforts to reduce pesticide use in agriculture.
Critical Raw Materials - Extraction & Import;TA3.10,TA3.11,TA3.8,TA3.9;Competitive Agriculture;+;The secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials can contribute to improved competitiveness in agriculture by reducing dependence on imported materials and promoting sustainable practices. This can lead to a more resilient and sustainable agricultural sector.
Net-Zero Technology - Manufacturing;TA3.12;Food quality;+;The development and manufacturing of net-zero technologies can lead to improved food quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable practices in food production. This can contribute to a more sustainable food system.
