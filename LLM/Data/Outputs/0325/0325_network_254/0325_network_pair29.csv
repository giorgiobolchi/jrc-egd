Food quality;TA5.30,TA5.32,TA5.33;Improve Air Quality;+;Improving food quality through sustainable agriculture practices can lead to reduced air pollution from agricultural activities, thus contributing to improved air quality. This is because sustainable agriculture practices often involve reduced use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which are significant contributors to air pollution.
Food quality - Animal Welfare;TA5.25;Improve Air Quality;+;Enhancing animal welfare in agriculture can lead to more sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices, which in turn can reduce air pollution. For example, free-range farming and organic farming methods can lead to lower emissions of ammonia and other pollutants.
Food quality - Healthy Food;TA5.26,TA5.27,TA5.28;Improve Water Quality;+;Promoting healthy food options can lead to increased demand for sustainable and locally sourced produce, which can reduce the environmental impact of transportation and support more environmentally friendly farming practices that conserve water and reduce pollution.
Food affordability;TA5.19,TA5.30,TA5.32;Improve Water Quality;-;Ensuring food affordability may lead to increased pressure on agricultural systems to produce more food at lower costs, potentially resulting in more intensive farming practices that can harm water quality. This could involve increased use of fertilizers and pesticides, which can pollute waterways.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Improve Air Quality;+;Reducing pesticide use can lead to improved air quality by decreasing the amount of harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere. This is because pesticides can evaporate and contribute to air pollution, and reducing their use can minimize this impact.
Pesticides Reduction;TA5.2,TA5.4,TA5.5;Improve Water Quality;+;Decreasing pesticide use can also improve water quality by reducing the amount of chemicals that enter waterways through runoff or leaching. This can help protect aquatic ecosystems and ensure cleaner water for human consumption.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20;Improve Soils Health;+;Promoting competitive agriculture through sustainable practices can lead to improved soil health. This is because sustainable agriculture often involves techniques like crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage, which can enhance soil fertility and structure.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20;Noise Reduction;-;Intensive agricultural practices aimed at increasing competitiveness may lead to increased noise pollution from machinery and equipment, potentially negatively impacting nearby ecosystems and human populations.
Competitive Agriculture;TA5.12,TA5.14,TA5.20;Social Security - Sanitation;+;Supporting competitive agriculture can lead to improved social security for farmers and rural communities, including better access to sanitation facilities. This is because competitive agriculture can generate income and stimulate local economic development, which can be invested in improving rural infrastructure and services.
