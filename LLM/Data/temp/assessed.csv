0;TA1.3;"The at least 55% economy-wide net reduction objective is enshrined in the Climate Law as an overall ambition at the EU level. Specific legislation covering different sectors translates this into sectoral ambition levels which cumulatively achieve the -55% target. This corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 62% in the existing ETS compared to 2005, a 40% reduction in ESR, (this is now complemented by 42% reduction target compared to 2005 in the newly established ETS2). With the aim of ensuring strong emissions reduction in other sectors, the overall contribution of the LULUCF sector to EU’s economy-wide target of − 55% by 2030 is limited to a maximum of − 225 MtCO2e/year. Achieving the LULUCF sector target of -310 MtCO2e in 2030 will elevate the total EU GHG emission reduction to approximately 57% compared to 1990. The total net EU greenhouse gases emissions, including LULUCF, were reduced by 32.5% between 1990 and 2022 [21]. GHG emission reductions need to double in the current decade compared to the previous decades (see charts in the annexes).
According to the Member States’ own projections reported in 2023 under Article 18 of the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation, total EU emissions are expected to fall in 2030 by about 50% below the 1990 level when factoring in additional measures. This falls short of the at least 55% objective, but the Member States projections do not accurately capture the evolution driven by EU-wide instruments such as the ETS.
Reaching the -55 % objective further depends on delivery of ESR, which is not fully on track, as well as the related functioning of ETS2. In addition, the -55% objective assumes that the LULUCF sink is at least -225 MtCO2e. The agreed LULUCF commitment of -310 MtCO2e could even achieve -57%. However, the current development of the LULUCF sink is opposite to the targets, including natural disturbances that are expected to further increase with the ongoing climate change [27], [28]. If this negative development continues, the risk of not reaching the sink of –225 MtCO2 cannot be ruled out.
On the other hand, the implementation of the complete Fit for 55 legislative package is expected to reduce EU net greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2030, putting EU on track to exceed 2030 targets [29].
On the way to climate neutrality by 2050, the Commission adopted a Communica- tion [23] in February 2024 that launches the process of setting the 2040 climate target for the EU, in compliance with Art. 4.3 of the Climate Law. While 2040 targets are not yet set, it is clear that much of the transition to 2050 has to be realised
by 2040. Based on the recommended emission reductions of 90-95 % by 2040 compared to 1990, of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change advised, the Commission has recommended a net 90% GHG reduction target for 2040.
Both 2040 and 2050 targets require a much deeper transformation of the energy system, through large scale deployment of climate-neutral technologies that require high investment efforts with some technologies not yet deployed at market scale. While some of the current instruments will keep delivering reductions well beyond 2030 (notably the EU ETS but also CO2 standards for vehicles, ReFuelEU Aviation, FuelEU Maritime and the Fluorinated gas (F-gas) Regulation), there will be a need
to review, update and complete the legislative framework for the post-2030 period. This will include topics such as carbon capture, industrial carbon removals, and overall and sector specific emission reduction trajectories. In addition, larger emis- sion reductions in difficult-to-abate sectors like agriculture will be needed, along with a larger role for carbon removals, including utilising land as a carbon sink."

2;TA1.10;"The ETS2 is a new EU-wide cap-and-trade economic instrument that covers the CO2 emissions from the combustion of fuels in road transport, buildings, and other sectors (mainly smaller industries), excluding agriculture. Monitoring starts in 2025, with cap and trade applying from 2027. As such, it overlaps significantly with the ESR in terms of sectors covered, but important differences are that a) it is implemented at the EU level, rather than through Member State-specific policies, and b) it does not cover non-CO2 emissions, many of which are from the hard-to- tackle agricultural sector.
Between 2005 and 2022, the emissions covered by the ETS 2 fell by 16% according to own estimates of the JRC. However, since the ETS2 instrument is newly implemented and official reporting by Member States is not yet available, the progress cannot currently be evaluated."

4;TA1.11;"The current (2022) reduction is 17% relative to 2005, far from the 40% reduction target set for 2030. Between 2013 and 2020, Member States met or overa- chieved their ESR obligations- with the largest reductions in the buildings and small industry sectors. Emissions are expected to continue decreasing in the com- ing decade due to –among others- source control legislation, such as improved building standards, building renovations, CO2 standards for road vehicles and EU policies on phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and other fluorinated gases. Progress in the transport and building sectors faces different challenges. While transport emissions are regulated by EU-wide CO2 emission standards for vehicles (which have a relatively fast turnover rate), renovating the building stock is a more challenging effort, primarily driven by Member States' policies. Therefore, Member States' projections for building emissions significantly lag behind the expected cost-effective rate of reduction [31].
Overall, EU emissions in the sectors covered by the ESR, according to 2023 Member States projections, are expected to fall by 27-32% (with existing and ad- ditional measures, respectively) by 2030 compared to 2005, i.e. 8 -13 percentage points below the 40% target for 2030, with only 6 Member States projected to (over-) achieve their targets [22].
Absolute emissions in the agriculture sector have stagnated since 2010, while agricultural aggregate output has increased, decreasing emission intensity of EU agricultural products by 13%.
Concerning emission reductions, current Member States' projections under the Governance Regulation foresee 2030 emissions with existing measures to be 373 MtCO2e (or -3% compared to 2021) and 359 MtCO2e (or -7 %) with additional measures. The 2030 ‘MIX (55 Euro/t CO2e)’ scenario, used to assess the Fit for 55 targets corresponds to a -7 % decline in the agricultural sector by 2030 compared to 2021, aligning with the Member States ‘with additional measures’ scenario. The current (2023-2027) CAP aims to contribute to climate mitigation, with Member State strategies outlined in their Strategic Plans. Estimates of the CAP 2023-2027 impact on emissions require detailed information on the implementation and effectiveness of farming practices from the CAP instruments, which are currently being evaluated."
5;TA1.12;"The revised LULUCF regulation sets a target of removing 310 MtCO2e by 2030. The long-term EU forest sink is developing away from this target and jeopard- ising the fulfilment of the overall LULUCF sector target for 2030. Furthermore, natural disturbances are expected to increase with ongoing climate change, with potentially a further reduction of the carbon sink, making the situation even more difficult.
In 2020, the gap between the reported LULUCF emissions in 2016-2018 and the target of -310 MtCO2e for 2030 was -42 MtCO2e for the EU. 2024 shows that this gap has now widened: instead of -42 MtCO2e, the EU needs to improve its LULUCF sink by -80 MtCO2e between 2022 and 2030 to meet the targets. The LULUCF targets will be difficult to achieve unless substantial changes in forest manage- ment are implemented very soon."
6;TA1.13;"Assessing the distance to the target is difficult. Comparing purely the GHG re- porting from countries for 2021 and 2022, to the accounting benchmark of -229 MtCO2e determined by the delegated act, it looks like the EU is slightly exceeding the accounting benchmark. However, the recalculations of the inventories have increased the net sink historical time series reported by the Member States, and those recalculations will be considered in the accounting. Given the sharp decline of the forest sink driven by increasing harvest levels and natural disturbances, it is likely that the EU will face an overall accounting debit (i.e. not reaching the target) than a credit in the LULUCF sector as a whole.
The reporting for years 2026-2029 will be done in GHG inventories during 2028- 2031."
7;TA1.14;
8;TA1.15;"In 2015 buildings direct GHG emissions were 541 MtCO2e, therefore the target value for 2030 is 216 MtCO2e.
European Climate Neutrality Observatory data shows past progress of 5 MtCO2e between 2016 and 2021. To meet the target, the required annual change between 2021 and 2030 needs to be 7.5 times faster than the past rate of progress. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40%
of the EU’s total energy consumption, and for 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions from energy (including indirect emissions). Buildings related emissions belonging to fossil fuelled district heating, electric heating and electricity use of heat pumps are covered by EU ETS, while the rest is covered by the ESR."

11;TA2.1;European production capacity is not yet officially monitored, but there are estimates of production of around 23ktH2/year, which is very far away from the target of 10 MtH2/year. Imports are currently non-existent.
12;TA2.10;"Innovative technologies are defined as those that improve in at least one way comparable state-of-the-art renewable energy technologies or make exploitable a largely untapped renewable energy resource, involving a clear degree of risk,
in technological, market or financial terms, which is higher than the risk generally associated with comparable non-innovative technologies or activities. According to the Association of European Renewable Energy Research Centers (EUREC)
[73], the EU’s industry is ready, in the right circumstances, to deploy innovative renewable energy technologies to a level likely to exceed 5%, including innovative technologies such as advanced photovoltaics, floating photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and solar thermal."
13;TA2.11;Joint projects allow for a cost-efficient deployment of renewable energy across Europe and contribute to market integration. Despite its potential, cooperation between Member States has been very limited, thus leading to suboptimal results in terms of efficiency in increasing renewable energy. There are a few projects under consideration and being planned, as well as some permitting and under construction. However, these are in localised areas across the EU and not homogeneously distributed between Member States.
14;TA2.12;
15;TA2.13;"The share of energy from renewable sources used in transport in the EU reached 9.6 % in 2022, up from 9.1% in 2021. Acceleration is needed to reach the 2030 target. Following a sharp 13.5% drop in transport related GHG emissions between 2019 and 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to European Environ- ment Agency (EEA) data, they surged upwards (by 8.6%) between 2020 and 2021 from 720.2 to 782.1 Mt (million tonnes) and the EEA forecasts a further 2.7% increase for 2022, which would restore emission levels to above the 800-Mtonne threshold (803.2 Mt in 2022).
CO2 emissions account for almost all transport related GHG emissions (98.9% in 2021) and far outstrip those of nitrous oxide (N2O) (0.9% in CO2 equivalent units) and methane (0.2% in CO2 equivalent units)."
16;TA2.14;"Energy for heating and cooling makes up around half of the EU’s total gross final energy consumption. The annual average increases would lead to a target of 32.48% share by 2030. In 2022, the share of energy from renewables in heating and cooling continued to rise, with the EU average standing at 24.8%, up 1.8 percentage points from 2021 (23.0%). However, the 2022 value is still below the expected annual average. In absolute terms, the gross final consumption
of renewable energy for heating and cooling purposes in the EU has gradually increased over time, mostly due to the contribution of biomass and heat pumps. However, a major push is required to meet the 2030 target.
Sweden led the way when it came to renewables in heating and cooling, with a 69.3% share, followed by Estonia (65.4%). Both countries use mostly biomass and heat pumps. They are followed by Latvia (61.0%), which relies mostly on biomass."
17;TA2.15;Two Member States (Malta and Sweden) have already reached their 2030 target. 18 Member States have achieved the 2022 target of 18%. However, in 2021, 10 Member States experienced a decline in their share respect their 2020 value. This occurred as well for seven Member States in 2022, nevertheless, two of them have still met their 2022 targets despite the decrease. The EU jointly has reached the 2022 sub-target.
18;TA2.16;A 1.6 percentage point annual increase leads to a 26% share of renewables by 2030. The share of renewables in 2022 was 10.7%, an increase from 9.7% in 2020. In absolute values, this is an increase from 23.3 Mtoe in 2021 to 24.1 Mtoe in 2022 Acceleration is needed to reach the 2030 target.
19;TA2.17;In 2021, 16 countries reported being on track to reach that target by 2030, or had already reached the target, but more interconnections are needed in some regions. Specifically, eight Member States have already met or are exceeding the EU target. Others commit in their draft NECPs to develop interconnections with neighbouring countries by investing in new transmission capacities and interconnectors, espe- cially in regions that are historically dependent on a single supplier and now aim to improve diversification. Moreover, some Member States (e.g. EE, FI, IT and PT) plan to diversify their energy mix by carrying out joint hydrogen infrastructure projects [7]. Overall, Member States have made good efforts to increase cross-border capacity and the completion of various Projects of Common Interest should further improve the interconnectivity levels. Some Member States (CZ, IT, PT RO, SI, SE) are reporting delays in the completion of the projects in particular due to permitting issues. Still further efforts are required to meet the 2030 objectives, especially in terms of timely delivery of the planned cross-border projects [72].
20;TA2.18;No data available for buildings, only for the heating and cooling sector. From this data, the most reported fuels and technologies in 2021 per country are: biomass (21 countries), heat pumps (19), solar thermal systems (17), geothermal systems (12) and other decentralised renewable sources (8).
21;TA2.19;
22;TA2.2;For the 2010-2021 period, energy communities in the EU were still a niche in most national energy markets, with an estimated 9250 energy communities currently in operation across the EU and highly unbalanced distribution among Member States. More than half of these are located in Germany and almost 1000 are in the Netherlands. To date, however, a systematic and cross-country database on citizen-led initiatives and projects is lacking [74].
23;TA2.20;
24;TA2.21;"14 Member States reported data on public buildings in their national energy
and climate progress reports (NECPRs). Missing data prevent drawing general conclusions or calculating aggregated data at the EU level. In terms of final energy, the short-term evolution indicates a general increase with some exceptions, such as the residential sector in Greece and Ireland. The first reporting deadline for the EED is at the end of 2024."
25;TA2.22;Final energy consumption reached 940 Mtoe in 2022, a 2.8% decrease compared with 2021. According to the EC assessment of the NECPs, the current Member States drafts pledges would lead to 5.8% energy efficiency improvements in 2030, compared to the target of 11.7%. Therefore, acceleration is needed to reach the 2030 target.
26;TA2.23;"In 2022, primary energy consumption in the EU reached 1257 Mtoe, a 4.1% decrease compared with 2021, moving closer to the 2030 target.
Following the decline registered in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic across sectors, EU primary energy consumption increased again in 2021. The year 2022 shows better results than in 2019, before the pandemic, when primary energy consumption was at 1354 Mtoe and 36.5% away from the target.
The 1257 Mtoe registered for primary energy consumption in 2022 was the second lowest level since 1990 (the first year for which data are available), and the lowest was in 2020 (1236 Mtoe).
According to the EC assessment of the NECPs, the current drafts would lead to a gap of 75 Mtoe from the 2030 target."
27;TA2.24;According to SWD(2023)646, several Member States did not reach their annual targets. Member States will have to step up their efforts to be able to meet the savings requirement in 2030.
28;TA2.25;The reference value for 2015 is 374.5 Mtoe. The final energy consumption (FEC) increased in 2021 to 391.2, value obtained from adding FEC from service and residential buildings (129.4 and 261.8 Mtoe). In 2022, the FEC decreased to 364.1 Mtoe, with 121.6 Mtoe coming from service buildings and 242.4 from residential buildings. Consumptions decreased by 2.8% in the 2015-2022 period.
29;TA2.26;"The weighted annual energy renovation rate in the EU is about 1%, rate should double to 2% to achieve the target. For residential buildings, the annual weighted energy renovation rate was estimated close to 1% within the EU (0.4-1.2% depending on the Member State), for the 2012-2016 period. As of 2021, the annual rate of deep renovation is only 0.2% for residential buildings and 0.3% for non-residential buildings.
Data on renovation rates in the NECPR are highly incomplete, with only seven Member States reporting in this field in 2023"

In 2021, FEC for space heating and cooling buildings was 247.2 Mtoe, obtained from adding FEC for space heating residential + FEC for air conditioning residential (only electricity) + FEC for space heating services + FEC for air conditioning = 170.72 + 1.01 + 64.9 + 10.6 = 247.2 Mtoe (data from [75]). Consumptions increased by 5.6% (2015-2021), instead of reducing.
Data for 2022 has not been published yet, however an estimate can be provided based on the 2015-2021 average share of services FEC for space heating and air conditioning to total services FEC (56%).
2022 FEC for space heating and cooling buildings = FEC for space heating residential + FEC for air conditioning residential (only electricity) + FEC for space heating and air conditioning services = 159.4 + 1.1 + 68.0 = 228 Mtoe. Consumptions expected to decrease by 1.3% (2015-2022)."

42;TA2.38;In 2023, the cumulative installed capacity for wind offshore was on the order of 19 GW (it was 16.2 GW in 2022). Annual installation rate grew from 1.2 GW/year to around 3GW/year. A substantial increase is required in annual installations to reach 60 GW by 2030 (about twice the increase rate). Additionally, Member States have agreed to a new more ambitious non-binding target of reaching 111 GW by 2030 and 317 GW by 2050.
43;TA2.39;"In 2023, the EU Member States installed in the order of 700 kW of
ocean energy (compared to 150 kW in 2022) and the cumulative ocean energy capacity in European sea basins is 43.8 MW. While there has been a positive increase in installations in the last year, the rate of annual installed capacity should still grow substantially to reach the 2030 target. Strong acceleration is needed."
44;TA2.4;The deployment rate was 2.2 million heat pumps in 2021 and 3 million in 2022. There are nearly 20 million heat pumps installed in the EU as of 2022. The current rate is enough to reach the 2030 target.
45;TA2.40;The use of renewable hydrogen in Europe is negligible at the moment. This also includes industrial processes. Several initiatives at the European level such as Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs), and the Hydrogen Bank, are expected to kick- start production of renewable hydrogen at scale. Several of the financed initiatives are targeting the production of green steel and currently Europe has the highest number of projects aimed at using renewable hydrogen for the production of steel.
46;TA2.5;The EU solar generation capacity keeps increasing and reached, according to SolarPower Europe, an estimated 260 GW in 2023, 224 GWac (ac: alternating current) according to JRC estimates [75]. Compared to 177 GWac (ac: alternating current) in 2022. Based on the latest data, the 2025 target could be achieved.
47;TA2.6;Share should be 4.5% by 2030. In 2021, the relative size of solar thermal in overall heat consumption was 0.687 TWh (0.1%), over the total of 651 TWh. According to EurObserv'ER, there was a 10% growth in 2022, while the required annual rate growth is 12% to reach the target.

According to the EC assessment of the draft NECPs, the current drafts would lead to a share of 38.6-39.3% of renewables in the energy mix by 2030. Reaching the 2030 target of 42.5% (and even more so the aspirational target of 45%) will require a much faster growth in the coming years."

The target aims at halving the amount of residual municipal waste by 2030. Assuming as a reference year the 2020, the residual municipal waste should be reduced from 119 to 59.5 Mtonnes.
Looking at historical trends, the amount of residual municipal waste decreased by only 5% in the time frame 2012-2021 and slightly increased in the last seven years (2015-2021, +2.6%). Despite increasing recycling levels, the amount of waste generated is increasing at a higher pace [130]."

62;TA3.21;The 2025 target for lithium-based batteries is in principle feasible, however due to the increasing diversity of lithium-based batteries on the market, it is important to closely monitor the performance towards the target. Furthermore, there are some improvement opportunities when data is available, recycling systems are established and when the target is revised by 2027.

Research also highlights that the total power output needed per electric vehicle (including battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles) is highly dependent on the share of electric cars and vans on the road, with AFIR targets on cumulative power outputs per vehicle being sufficient in the long term (when a rise in the market share of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles is expected) [157].

to prevent, minimise and mitigate their adverse impacts. The implementation is underpinned by EASIN (European Alien Species Information Network), which also hosts the European early warning system on IAS of Union concern.

Because of the recent approval of the Nature Restoration Law, not enough data is available yet."
207;TA6.34;Considering the last report on the conservation status and trends in conservation status of marina habitats, a significant percentage of their status remains unknown [206].

213;TA6.4;The target has been welcomed and endorsed by the European Council, which is key for this target. The Commission issued Guidelines [211]for defining, mapping, monitoring and strictly protecting EU Primary and Old-Growth Forests in 2023. However, there is still a lack of a clear, uniform definition of what constitutes primary and old-growth forests. As a result, while it is likely that the target will be met, it remains unclear whether all forests that should be protected will actually receive protection.
214;TA6.40;Based on trends in the grassland butterfly index, pollinators are still declining. Another indicator that would include more pollinators is under development to better characterise the decline of pollinators.
215;TA6.41;"The EU has reached only 12% of MPA, with less than 1% being strictly protected. The target could be partially achieved if the NRL is immediately implemented (including a clear financial system), along with the targets of the Biodiversity Strategy (i.e. 30% MPA and 10% strictly protected areas), and if Member States react in a timely manner.
The complete achievement of the target is strictly dependent on the restoration methods and selected marine ecosystems to be restored. The timescale of the recovery period varies as diverse are the marine habitats to restore. Beyond this there are other challenges that Member States have to face [205].
The actual implementation of the BDS target on effective marine protected areas (30% overall and 10% strictly protected by 2030), through passive restoration method, as well as the other directives (e.g. WFD and MSFD), and the 2023 Marine Action Plan would contribute to achieve this target.
Regarding the condition and restoration, there are only two ways to judge this: (a) comparison with old large fully protected MPA, and (b) the use of indicators, some of which still need to be developed. There is no data on how impacted most areas are, but indicators such as present fishing activities altering food webs, or bottom trawling and dredging destroying benthic habitats, would contribute to the final assessment. However, the precautionary principle should be applied, assuming marine ecosystems everywhere are impacted unless evidence suggests otherwise."
216;TA6.42;"Considering the last report on the conservation status and trend in conservation status of marine habitats, most of the marine areas are between categories UNFAVOURABLE (U1/U2) and UNKNOWN (XX) status.
There are some examples of restoration measures already put in place across European Sea, but without an immediate implementation of NRL, as well as other directives (e.g. BDBS, WFD, MSFD), the EGD target would not be achieved Additional observation: As mentioned before, marine restoration can be achieved passively by no take MPA. Therefore, the increase in area that is fully protected would be a reasonable indicator of restoration. To the best of available knowledge, there is no evidence that part-protection works. Evidence of recovered species usually appear within five years but full recovery e.g. of urchin-kelp trophic cascades, may take 20 years. Since restoration is by definition a return to fully natural conditions, partly protected areas do not qualify as restoration.
Regarding the condition and restoration of marine areas, there are only two ways to judge this: (a) comparison with old, large fully protected MPA, and (b) the use of indicators, some of which still need to be developed.

217;TA6.43;In the last report on the conservation status and trend in conservation status of marine habitats, there is still a quite important percentage of marine environ- ments with UNKNOWN status (either XX or U1/U2) [206]. Member States should implement more effective monitoring programmes to assess the status of marine habitats in order to achieve the EGD target.
218;TA6.44;At the moment the trend in the grassland butterfly index is still declining. The carbon stocks in EU agricultural soils have declined by 0.75% in the period 2009-2018 based on measured LUCAS data.

The net land take in urban areas during 2012-2018 amounted to 2.696 km2, corresponding to 450km2 annually. 1 415km2 or 47% of all land take took place in arable lands, impacting food security, carbon sequestration and the maintaining of biodiversity. The second largest land take took place
  in pastures — a loss of 945km2 or 36% of all land take. Pastures are among Europe’s most important biodiversity hotspots and soil carbon sinks."
226;TA6.51;"The level of access to clean drinking water in Europe is high according to the WASH database by the WHO and UNICEF. However, as reported by the EEA,
the levels of treatment and accessibility are lower in rural areas than in urban locations. Disparities in access to safe drinking water among ethnic groups in Europe emerged as well. The revised Drinking Water Directive includes additional parameters than the 46 microbiological, chemical and indicator parameters of the first Drinking Water Directive. The new parameters include per- and polyfluorinated compounds and bisphenol A, setting limit values for their presence in drinking water. As of the end of 2022, EU level data on drinking water quality were still limited, with the latest data available dating from 2011 and 2013. The new directive also foresees a watch list mechanism for emerging pollutants.
The Directive’s Impact Assessment includes the calculation of the “SAPEA” Popu- lation Potentially at Health Risk indicator, estimating the share of the population that could potentially suffer from health problems because of the presence of contaminants in drinking water. According to the indicator, in 2015, 22.7 million people were potentially at health risk due to non-safe drinking water, equivalent
to 4 % of the EU population. The revised Directive is expected to positively impact drinking water quality. However, estimated data for 2015 is not sufficient to assess the status of drinking water quality with respect to its evolution over time and new additional parameters by the revised directive, as confirmed by the EEA. Member States have started complying with the reporting requirements in 2023."
227;TA6.52;In the European Union, air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk, causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that lead to the loss of healthy years of life and, in the most serious cases, premature deaths (about 240 000 reported in the European Union (EU) for 2021). Although emissions of air pollutants have been reduced over recent decades (primarily as a result of legislation), air quality remains a major concern in many parts of Europe. Air quality limits set by EU legislation for particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone continue to be exceeded, especially in many urban areas.

As of April 2024, water reuse for agricultural irrigation is allowed in most Member States. Some Member States, where freshwater resources are abundant and irrigation demand is low, have planned not to allow water reuse for irrigation in their countries. Some Member States have not yet made a final decision, as resource and infrastructure costs still are being evaluated (source: WISE Freshwater website).

239;TA6.9;"Indicator: Use and risk of chemical pesticides (Source: DG SANTE).
According to a trend analysis by DG SANTE, the use and risk of chemical pesticides decreased by 14% between the baseline period of 2015–2017 and 2020. The use and risk of chemical pesticides shows a decrease of 6% from 2020, and an overall decrease in the first four years of observation of 33% from the baseline period of 2015-2017. These overall downward trends shows that the first part of the target can be achieved by 2030 [182]. On the other side, according to data published
by DG SANTE, the use of more hazardous pesticides fell by 21% between the baseline period of 2015–2017 and 2021. The use of more hazardous pesticides shows an increase of 5% from 2020 to 2021. Achievement of the 50% reduction target by 2030 remains challenging. It should be noted, while this indicator intends to monitor the use of the more hazardous pesticides, it does not take into account the exposure and hence the impact they might have on the environment and human health. In the future, this indicator should be complemented with a risk indicator showing changes in the actual risks.
1 It should be noted that the current EU-wide indicator, which applies risk weightings to four differ- ent groups of chemical pesticides and is based on pesticide sales, is not considered scientifically robust by some. This indicator is based on a similar harmonised risk indicator, which, according
to the European legislation (Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782), is considered hazard-based. This is due to the absence of statistics on the use of plant protection products needed to develop a risk indicator. The Commission is committed to developing more sophisticated indicators in future, such as improved weightings that take hazard properties into account in a more granular way or by using EU-level data on pesticide usage when it becomes available. An example of
such an improvement is the new risk indicator assessing the toxicity of pesticide residues in soil from samples collected under the LUCAS Soil Pesticide survey coordinated by JRC. According to this indicator, in 2018, 14% of sites in the EU were at risk of negative effects on soil organisms due to pesticide residues. The analysis of samples from 2022 is currently ongoing and will shed light on the EU’s progress towards pesticide risk reductions. This indicator is relevant to only one compartment (soil) but is just one of many being examined for usefulness and relevance. "

Soil erosion has decreased by around 10% in the period 2000-2016, but future trends are alarming due to climate change.

at wastewater treatment facilities increases treatment costs, and complete removal is not always feasible. The proposal encourages more proactive measures upstream by reducing emissions at their source. By avoiding water pollution, the proposal will also benefit the potential for water reuse. The enhanced watch list mechanism requiring Member States to monitor new substances, will enable
the Commission, with the support of the European Chemicals Agency and the Member States, to determine the need for additional or stricter quality standards. More frequent reporting of actual monitoring data, and its analysis by the EEA, will provide the EU Institutions, Member States, and the general public with a more precise and current understanding of the status of surface and groundwater bodies in the EU. The analysis of more regular monitoring and status data will effectively feed into the broader Zero Pollution Monitoring and Outlook framework"

258;TA7.4;The IED is a key instrument to support the transition of the EU industry towards a climate neutral, clean and circular economy. The revised legislation will lead to a considerable reduction of pollution from industry and level the playing field. For example, it is expected to deliver, latest by 2050, up to 40% additional reduction of key air pollutants.
259;TA7.5;"Access to sanitation. There is a positive trend in the access to basic sanitation and connection to secondary wastewater treatment. Overall, the share of population without a bath, shower, or indoor flushing toilet in their household decreased from 2.2% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2020 [234]. However, in some Member States, there were still high shares of the population without access to basic sanitary facilities in 2020. The share of the EU population connected to secondary wastewater treatment has also increased continuously since 2000, reaching 81.1% in
2020 [234]. The revision of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive aims to bring additional improvements not only for water quality, but also for access to sanitation [235].
Secondary treatment. Small agglomerations constitute a significant pressure
on 11% of the EU’s surface water bodies [236]. Currently, the situation varies across the EU, with some Member States requesting all urban wastewater to be treated and others having set standards for small agglomerations beyond the requirements set in Directive 91/271/EEC [237].
Tertiary treatment. In many cases, nitrogen and phosphorus are well removed from wastewater, but there are still regions where additional removal could bring a significant benefit to the environment. In many cases, the costs of additional removal are well below the benefits that could be achieved, and some wastewater treatment plants operate already beyond the requirements of Directive 91/271/ EEC. The revision of the Directive aims to push nutrient removal further by imposing stricter standards. This would also contribute indirectly to the reduction of GHG emissions.
Quaternary treatment. While secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment
is being implemented compliant with Directive 91/271/EEC, several chemical micropollutants escape treatment plants and contribute to pollution of the receiving waters (e.g. pharmaceuticals and ingredients in personal care products). The revision of the Directive aims to require quaternary treatment for all larger plants, also based on an extended producer responsibility scheme that would help finance the corresponding treatment costs."
