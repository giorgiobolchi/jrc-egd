## Each Member State shall reduce the packaging waste generated per capita, as compared to the packaging waste generated per capita in 2018 as reported to the Commission in accordance with Decision 2005/270/EC by 5% by 2030; 10% by 2035; 15% by 2040 Proposal on packaging and packaging waste

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: On average, the packaging waste generated increased from 157 kg per person in 2011 to 178 kg per person in 2020. Most Member States have reported
a steady growth in packaging waste generation per capita in the period of 2011-2020, particularly Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Czechia [99]. Currently, none of the Member States is on track to reach the packaging waste reduction targets. However, the newly agreed Plastic and Packaging Waste Regulation intends to bend the currently observed stagnant or upward trend of packaging waste generation through a number of measures, in particular binding reuse and refill requirements.
