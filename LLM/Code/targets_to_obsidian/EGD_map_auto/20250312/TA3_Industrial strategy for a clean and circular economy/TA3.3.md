## Double EUâ€™s circular material use rate in the coming decade
A new Circular Economy Action Plan

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: This target aims to increase the circular material use rate (CMUR) from 11.7% in 2020 to 23.4% in 2030. At the EU level, this target has been steady since 2010, registering an increase of less than 1 percentage point [131]. As such, there is a stagnation in the pace of improvement of the CMUR indicator. At the Member State level, CMUR shows a high variability with values ranging from 0.6 to 27.5% in 2022.
