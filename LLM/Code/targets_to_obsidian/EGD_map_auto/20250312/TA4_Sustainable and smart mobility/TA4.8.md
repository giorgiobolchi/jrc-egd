## Member States with maritime ports shall endeavour to ensure that as of 2030 the share of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) in the total amount of energy supplied to the maritime transport sector is at least 1.2%.
Directive (EU) 2023/2413

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: Synthetic fuels are not available on the market and conversion pathways are at early technology development levels, facing major techno-economic challenges. E-fuels facilities are still at the demo-scale, with only a few plants currently operated at the EU level [156].
RFNBOs is a promising solution for hard-to-electrify sectors, such as the maritime one. However, a market for maritime RFNBO is currently yet to develop. Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 also introduces a combination of measures to ensure the support to the uptake of sustainable RFNBOs. The deal also set a 2% renewable fuels usage target as of 2034 if the Commission reports that in 2031 RFNBO will amount to less than 1% in fuel mix.
