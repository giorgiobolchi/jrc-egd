Assessment: The target supports the vision of 3 million charging points by 2030 under the Sustainable and Smart Mobility strategy. As of mid-2024, around 730.000 charging points are available in the EU (see TENtec Interactive Map Viewer). According to the EC Dashboard towards zero-emission vehicle, around 60% of charging points in the EU are concentrated in three EU countries (Germany, France, Netherlands), while Eastern EU is lagging behind. To meet the 3 million charging points ambition, around 400.000 new points need to be installed annually, with a significant gap with respect to the 153.000 new public charging points installed in 2023 [158].
