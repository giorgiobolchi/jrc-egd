## Member States shall ensure that, by 31 December 2030, publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling stations with a total capacity of at least 1 tonne per day,
and equipped with at least a 700 bar dispenser, are deployed at least every 200 km along the TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Network) core network Regulation (EU) 2023/1804

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: The extent of the urban nodes equipped with publicly accessible hydrogen refuel- ling stations is mostly localised in the central-northern EU (see TENtec Interactive Map Viewer). The number of Hydrogen refuelling stations is steadily increasing in the EU. The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation sets the minimum goals for hydrogen refuelling stations deployment until 2030, which should significantly increase from the current 200 operational stations
(see Clean Hydrogen Monitor 2023, p. 145)
