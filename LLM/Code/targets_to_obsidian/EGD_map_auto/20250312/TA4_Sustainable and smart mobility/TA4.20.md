## In the first phase, from 2020 up to 2024, the strategic objective is to install at least 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers in the EU. In the second
phase, from 2025 up to 2030, the strategic objective is to install at least 40 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers.
A Hydrogen Strategy for a climate-neutral Europe

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: Initiatives are ongoing and deployment of electrolysers is increasing, but it is unlikely that the target of deploying 6 GW of hydrogen generation capacity will be reached by the end of 2024.
