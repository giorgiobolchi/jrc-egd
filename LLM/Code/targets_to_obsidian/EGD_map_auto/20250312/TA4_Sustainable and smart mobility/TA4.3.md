## The yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship during a reporting period shall
be reduced, compared to the reference value (91.16 gCO2e/MJ) by: 2% from 1 January 2025; 6% from
1 January 2030; 14.5% from 1 January 2035; 31% from 1 January 2040; 62% from 1 January 2045; 80% from 1 January 2050.

Assessment: EU shipping emissions increased by 5.6% in 2021 from the previous year, rebounding from the COVID-19 induced slump of 2020. The target for 2025 seems unlikely to be reached.
The EEA projections suggest that, even with measures currently planned in the Member States, emissions from domestic navigation are projected to remain relatively stable in the coming years. International maritime transport emissions are projected to continue increasing.
