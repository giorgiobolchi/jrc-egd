## For [...] “urban buses” manufacturers shall comply with the 90% (in the reporting period 2030-2034) and 100% (as from 2035) minimum shares in their fleet of new heavy-duty vehicles
Regulation (EU) 2024/1610

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: Following the Regulation, due to the technical readiness of urban buses and
the need to improve urban air quality, this target supports the need to have a mandatory minimum share of new zero-emission urban buses. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) and Rabobank, the whole EU bus fleet consists of around 715.000-750.000 vehicles, with city buses representing around 215.000 units (around 30%). Looking at city buses only, there has been a steady decrease in the number of new city buses fuelled by Diesel since 2016, increasingly being replaced by electric vehicles. A market growth average close to 18% could help achieve the 2030 target. This is feasible, given the 2020-2023 market trend (source: Rabobank). It should be finally noted that a collapse of the diesel buses market is unlikely (e.g. due to the need in rural areas), and new electrically chargeable buses accounted for 12.7% in the total EU bus market in 2022, making up only 1.4% of total buses on EU roads (source: ACEA).
