Assessment: The extent of the TEN-T network equipped with safe and secure parking complying with the target is localised in central-northern EU (see TENtec Interactive Map Viewer). However, data available is not updated and it is not possible to assess whether the current number of secure parking areas for heavy-duty electric vehicles and the speed of installation is sufficient to reach the 2030 target.
