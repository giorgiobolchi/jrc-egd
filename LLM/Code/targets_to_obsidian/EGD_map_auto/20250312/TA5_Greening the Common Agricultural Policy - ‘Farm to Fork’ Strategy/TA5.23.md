Assessment: This indicator gives total employment in agriculture, the food industry and food services in absolute terms and also as a share of total employment. The employment in the food sector by economic activity has decreased over the last decade, from 8,474 (in 2013) to 6,326 (in 2022) million persons. During this period the mean annual decrease was 2.88% based on CAGR calculation, therefore around 25% of the employment moved out from the food sector in almost a decade. The share of total employment has also decreased, from 5% (in 2013) to 3% (in 2022). This negative trend indicates a move away from the objective, which aims at creating new job opportunities in the food sector. Indicator: Employment by economic activity (Source: Eurostat).
