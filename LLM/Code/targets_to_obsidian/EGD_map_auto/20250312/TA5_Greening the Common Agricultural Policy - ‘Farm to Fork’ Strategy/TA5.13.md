Assessment: Indicator: Food Waste (Source: Eurostat). It should be noted that at the moment only two data points are available, 2020 and 2021, therefore, it is still early to define a clear trend. The Member States should report on food waste every year, using primary data at least once every four years. Based on the analysis performed in the impact assessment of the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, this target was not deemed to be feasible to achieve [108]. In the proposal the target has been redefined with a reduction of food consumption by 30% at retail and consumption level, plus a reduction of 10% in manufacturing (see Thematic Area 3).
