## Ensure that agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and the food value chain contribute to the target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 and to the
achievement of the objective for a climate-neutral Union in 2050.

Assessment: The trend (from 1990 to 2018) of this indicator for the EU 27 countries covering the GHG emissions from the
entire food value chain (from production to consumption within the EU territory) is in the desired direction to contribute to the 55% net reduction and climate neutrality targets set by the EC for all economic sectors in the EU combined. However, the
lack of current data, and the unpredictability of certain components of the GHG food system emission indicator (as temporal or geographical changes
in LULUC), make the prediction to 2030 very uncertain. In 2018 (the last recorded year in the time series) the total EU GHG food system emissions
represented 85.86% of the GHG food system emissions in 1990. Indicator: GHG food system emissions (Source: JRC EDGAR Food).
