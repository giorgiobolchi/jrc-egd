Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: According to
JRC study [183], the EU food system is transgressing several planetary boundaries including climate change and those related to novel entities (particulate matter, freshwater ecotoxicity). The Consumption Footprint related to food consumption
has shown an increasing trend since 2010, with the consumption of animal-based products dominating the impacts (around 70%). This increasing trend was common for most of the Member States (20 out of 27) [184].
