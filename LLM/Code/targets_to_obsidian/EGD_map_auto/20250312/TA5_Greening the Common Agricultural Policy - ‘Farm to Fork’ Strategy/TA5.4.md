## Reduce by 50% the use of more hazardous pesticides
Target in Common with Biodiversity Strategy (see Thematic Area 6) and Zero Pollution Action Plan (see Thematic Area 7)

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: Indicator: Use of more hazardous pesticides (Source: DG SANTE).
According to data published by DG SANTE, the use of more hazardous pesticides fell by 21 % between the baseline period of 2015–2017 and 2021. The use
of more hazardous pesticides shows an increase of 5% from 2020 to 2021. Achievement of the 50% reduction target by 2030 remains challenging.
It should be noted that while this indicator intends to monitor the use of the more hazardous pesticides, it does not take into account the exposure and hence the impact they might have on the environment and human health. In the future, this indicator could be complemented with a risk indicator showing changes in the actual risks2.
2 Options include better grouping of substances, group weighting reflecting substances’ toxicities, standardisation of sales data with recommended application rates and utilisation of pesticide use data instead of the sales data as the basis for a new indicator
