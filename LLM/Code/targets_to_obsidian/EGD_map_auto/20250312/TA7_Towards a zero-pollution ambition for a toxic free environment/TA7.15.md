## Improve water quality by reducing microplastics released into the environment (by 30%)

Thematic area: #TA7_Towards_a_zero_pollution_ambition_for_a_toxic_free_environment

Assessment: Microplastics concentration in soils is expected to increase, mainly due to the incorporation through the disposal of the sewage sludge and other agricultural practices such as plastics greenhouse, mulching films, drip irrigation, polymer-con- trolled release fertilisers and silage films. However, there is no harmonised methodology for their identification and quantification, and one should still be developed. The current database on soil pollution with plastics is still poor and no good prediction could be done. The EU has taken measures to combat microplastic pollution on all fronts (e.g. ban of certain single-use plastic products, restriction of intentionally produced microplastics and reduction of plastic pellet loss), aiming at reducing microplastic releases to the environment by 30% by 2030.
