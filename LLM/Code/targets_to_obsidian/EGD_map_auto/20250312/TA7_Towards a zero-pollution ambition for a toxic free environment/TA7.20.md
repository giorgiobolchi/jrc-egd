## Having all soils in healthy condition by 2050

Thematic area: #TA7_Towards_a_zero_pollution_ambition_for_a_toxic_free_environment

Assessment: The EU Soil Health Assessment (see EUSO Dashboard) estimated that 60-70% of EU soils are not in healthy condition, in accordance also with other reports [196], [238]. 25% of the EU soils and 33% of EU Agricultural soils have soil erosion rates higher than sustainability ones. Soil erosion has decreased by around 10% in the period 2000-2016, but future trends are alarming due to climate change. Soil loss by water erosion is projected to increase by 13â€“22.5 % in EU and UK by 2050.
