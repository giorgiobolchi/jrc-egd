## At least double the annual energy renovation rate of residential and non-residential buildings by 2030 and to foster deep energy renovations.
A Renovation Wave for Europe

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: The weighted annual energy renovation rate in the EU is about 1%, rate should double to 2% to achieve the target. For residential buildings, the annual weighted energy renovation rate was estimated close to 1% within the EU (0.4-1.2% depending on the Member State), for the 2012-2016 period. As of 2021, the annual rate of deep renovation is only 0.2% for residential buildings and 0.3% for non-residential buildings.
Data on renovation rates in the NECPR are highly incomplete, with only seven Member States reporting in this field in 2023
