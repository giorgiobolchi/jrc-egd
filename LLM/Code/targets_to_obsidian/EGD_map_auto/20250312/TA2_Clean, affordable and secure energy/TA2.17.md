## A target of 15% electricity interconnection for 2030
RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413)

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: In 2021, 16 countries reported being on track to reach that target by 2030, or had already reached the target, but more interconnections are needed in some regions. Specifically, eight Member States have already met or are exceeding the EU target. Others commit in their draft NECPs to develop interconnections with neighbouring countries by investing in new transmission capacities and interconnectors, espe- cially in regions that are historically dependent on a single supplier and now aim to improve diversification. Moreover, some Member States (e.g. EE, FI, IT and PT) plan to diversify their energy mix by carrying out joint hydrogen infrastructure projects [7]. Overall, Member States have made good efforts to increase cross-border capacity and the completion of various Projects of Common Interest should further improve the interconnectivity levels. Some Member States (CZ, IT, PT RO, SI, SE) are reporting delays in the completion of the projects in particular due to permitting issues. Still further efforts are required to meet the 2030 objectives, especially in terms of timely delivery of the planned cross-border projects [72].
