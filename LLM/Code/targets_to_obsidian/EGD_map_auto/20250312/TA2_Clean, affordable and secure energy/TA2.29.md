## Member states will have to renovate 16% of worst- performing non-residential buildings by 2030 and, by 2033, the worst-performing 26% through minimum energy performance requirements.
EPBD (Directive (EU) 2024/1275)

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: Member States use different approaches to define their worst performing stock, such as energy class, age, energy consumption, as resulted by the analysis of the last long term building renovation strategies. In their NECPRs, a total of 6 countries defined worst performance according the primary or final energy consumption in kWh/m2, while no information was found in 12 other countries.
