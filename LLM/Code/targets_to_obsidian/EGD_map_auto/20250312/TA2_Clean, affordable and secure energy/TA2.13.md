## The amount of renewable fuels and renewable electricity supplied to the transport sector leads to a: (i) share of renewable energy within the final consumption of energy in the transport sector of at least 29 % by 2030; or
(ii) GHG intensity reduction of at least 14.5 % by 2030, compared to the baseline set out in Article 27(1), in accordance with an indicative trajectory set by the Member State.

Assessment: The share of energy from renewable sources used in transport in the EU reached 9.6 % in 2022, up from 9.1% in 2021. Acceleration is needed to reach the 2030 target. Following a sharp 13.5% drop in transport related GHG emissions between 2019 and 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to European Environ- ment Agency (EEA) data, they surged upwards (by 8.6%) between 2020 and 2021 from 720.2 to 782.1 Mt (million tonnes) and the EEA forecasts a further 2.7% increase for 2022, which would restore emission levels to above the 800-Mtonne threshold (803.2 Mt in 2022).
CO2 emissions account for almost all transport related GHG emissions (98.9% in 2021) and far outstrip those of nitrous oxide (N2O) (0.9% in CO2 equivalent units) and methane (0.2% in CO2 equivalent units).
