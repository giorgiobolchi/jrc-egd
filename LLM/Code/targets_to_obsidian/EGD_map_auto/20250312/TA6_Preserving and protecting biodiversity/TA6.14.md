## 12. There is a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by Invasive Alien Species (IAS) Biodiversity Strategy

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: The expected acceleration in the number of alien species introductions and establishment due to global trade (including web trade), travel, and climate change, can lead to increased adverse impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, human health and the economy. The Regulation (EU) 1143/2014 (IAS Regulation) includes a set of measures to be taken across the EU in relation to IAS, aiming
to prevent, minimise and mitigate their adverse impacts. The implementation is underpinned by EASIN (European Alien Species Information Network), which also hosts the European early warning system on IAS of Union concern. The actions fostered by the EU biodiversity Strategy for 2023 aim at stepping up the IAS Regulation and other relevant legislation and international agreements with the objective of managing established IAS, decreasing the number of Red List species they threaten.
