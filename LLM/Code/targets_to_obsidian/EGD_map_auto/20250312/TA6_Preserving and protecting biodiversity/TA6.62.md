## Reach no net land take
(EU Soil Strategy for 2030)

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: Over the 2012-2018 period, the majority (78%) of the net land take happened in commuting zones. The net land take in urban areas during 2012-2018 amounted to 2.696 km2, corresponding to 450km2 annually. 1 415km2 or 47% of all land take took place in arable lands, impacting food security, carbon sequestration and the maintaining of biodiversity. The second largest land take took place
  in pastures — a loss of 945km2 or 36% of all land take. Pastures are among Europe’s most important biodiversity hotspots and soil carbon sinks.
