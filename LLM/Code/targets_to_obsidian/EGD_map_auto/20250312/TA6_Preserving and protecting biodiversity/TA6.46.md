Assessment: In the last report on the conservation status and trend in conservation status of marine habitats, there is still a quite important percentage of marine environ- ments with UNKNOWN status (either XX or U1/U2) [206]. Member States should implement more effective monitoring programmes to assess the status of marine habitats in order to achieve the EGD target.
