## Reduce buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, by 2030 (compared to 2015), and reach climate neutrality by 2050
A Renovation Wave for Europe

Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: In 2015 buildings direct GHG emissions were 541 MtCO2e, therefore the target value for 2030 is 216 MtCO2e.
European Climate Neutrality Observatory data shows past progress of 5 MtCO2e between 2016 and 2021. To meet the target, the required annual change between 2021 and 2030 needs to be 7.5 times faster than the past rate of progress. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40%
of the EU’s total energy consumption, and for 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions from energy (including indirect emissions). Buildings related emissions belonging to fossil fuelled district heating, electric heating and electricity use of heat pumps are covered by EU ETS, while the rest is covered by the ESR.
