The analysis encompasses 154 quantifiable targets from 44 policy documents between 2019 and 2024 across key sectors such as climate, energy, circular economy, transport, agriculture and food, ecosystems and biodiversity, water, soil and air pollution. The study shows that significant achievement has been delivered so far but progress needs to accelerate in many areas. As of mid-2024, 32 of the 154 targets are currently “on track” and 64 are identified as “acceleration needed” meaning that more progress is needed to meet the targets on time. Furthermore, 15 of the targets are found to be “not progressing” or “regressing”, and for 43 of the targets no data is currently available. The timing of the binding policies, most of which have been recently agreed and are expected to deliver results in the coming years, is a significant factor influencing these assessments. This report integrates all EGD actions and related policies, offering an assessment of the EU’s green transition based on robust data and science. It identifies priority areas for intensified efforts to meet short-term implementation goals and contribute to the long-term ambition of a sustainable, fair, just, and climate-neutral Europe by 2050. This collective work serves as a benchmarking tool, providing scientifically grounded guidance for future EU policies and programmes.

I am pleased to present this comprehensive report on the status and progress towards the European Green Deal’s goals and targets across all domains. It is the result of collective efforts and extensive collaboration among many scientists of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The report also integrates expertise from some of our external partner organisations and constitutes an important instrument of knowledge for future policymaking, providing a comprehensive overview of the EU's status (as of mid-2024) with respect to the ambitions of the European Green Deal. With a foundation in rigorous data analysis, this report provides clear evidence of how far we have come with respect to the main policy targets, where challenges persist, and where we need to accelerate the pace of transformation. It is both a reflection of the EU Green Deal achievements so far, and a guide for steering its further implementation in the years ahead. Despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis, the EU has demonstrated ambition and resilience in pursuing its climate and environmental objectives. The European Council's 2024-2029 \"strategic agenda\" has reaffirmed the commitment to making a success of the green and digital transitions, focusing on creating the markets, industries, and high-quality jobs of the future. The European Commission, under the leadership of President von der Leyen, has reaffirmed its commitment to the green transition, emphasising the need to stay the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal. The findings in this report remind us that progress is uneven. Disparities among Member States, energy security challenges, and socio-political shifts demand concerted action to bridge gaps and ensure that no one is left behind in this transition. The challenges we face are substantial, but so are the opportunities. The European Green Deal is not only a climate strategy but a blueprint for fostering economic resilience, social cohesion, and global leadership. Achieving its objectives requires a collective effort by policymakers, businesses and citizens. As the science for policy service of the European Commission, the JRC remains committed to supporting this transition by providing the tools and analysis needed to align ambition with results, and I am grateful to the many JRC scientists who have worked together to produce this report. I hope that it will be a valuable resource for policymakers, stakeholders and citizens committed to working together to achieving the targets and ambitions of the European Green Deal and providing a foundation for the future Clean Industrial Deal.

An unprecedented effort was started with the European Green Deal (EGD), a suite of new policies and amended legislation across seven thematic areas, aiming to drive progress towards a greener and more prosperous EU. By measuring progress against a range of agreed ambitions, this report provides a comprehensive, cross-cutting approach to understanding exactly where the EU stands in mid-2024. While implementation schedules for many of the EGD targets are still being put in place, the report monitors initial progress and identifies potential gaps, seeking to support the success of the green transition in the coming years. As the European Commission’s in-house research service, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) has conducted this analysis based on publicly available data, sound scientific knowledge and the most up-to-date trends. The report filters, distils and makes sense of the vast amount of information available both inside and outside the JRC, conveying it as clearly and transparently as possible. This report presents a snapshot of the current status of EGD target implementation, providing an early assessment to benchmark progress towards the achievement of EGD goals. It does not evaluate the policies themselves and it is naturally framed by certain constraints. First, the number of targets per thematic area does not necessarily reflect their relative importance. Rather, the number of targets depends on various factors, such as the types of policy documents and the nature of the topics. The assessment of progress provides an overview of the current state of play but does not evaluate the relative impact of these targets in terms of environmental, social, or economic aspects, or policy timing. Second, the traffic light system used to assess the progress of targets incorporates, where possible, existing sectorial modelling exercises in the analysis, or assumes in certain cases a linear trajectory based on the most updated trends. This approach is in alignment with other reports such as Eurostat's Monitoring report on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in an EU context, the European Environment Agency (EEA) stocktake of the 8th Environment Action Programme, and the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change's progress report of 2024. Third, a forward-looking approach would ideally involve complex scenario modelling, which is beyond the scope of this report. Nevertheless, the report establishes an important baseline against which to benchmark further progress. The analysis encompasses 154 targets in total, from 44 key policy documents. Some are legally binding while others are non-binding. The inclusion of non-binding targets, such as those under the Biodiversity Strategy, supports comprehensive reporting across the EGD's full ambitions and is crucial for areas with limited legislation. 4Progress has been made on 96 targets (62% of the total), of which 32 (21%) are on track to be met while for 64 targets (41%), the pace will need to be accelerated to meet the ambitions. For 15 targets (10%), the trend is either in reverse or stagnant, indicating the need to step up efforts to ensure their achievement. Data is not yet available for a further 43 targets (28%), but many of these are the products of recent policies whose effects will become clear in the coming years. These trends are confirmed when looking exclusively at the 87 identified legally binding targets (56% of the whole target set). A total of 42 are progressing to some extent. However, only 13 (15%) of these are progressing at the necessary speed to meet the EGD ambitions. Progress needs to accelerate on the other 29 (33%) to meet the final objectives. There are 12 targets (14%) for which the trend is either in reverse or stagnant. Data is not yet available for the remaining 33 targets (38%). The report also identifies areas that may require additional effort to meet implementation of targets in the short term and contribute to climate neutrality in the long term. This report is unique in its scope, addressing all EGD actions and related policies in one integrated analysis. The work is split into thematic areas: climate ambition; clean, affordable and secure energy (including building and renovating in an energy- and resource-efficient way); industrial strategy for a clean and circular economy; sustainable and smart mobility; greening the Common Agricultural Policy and the ‘Farm to Fork’ Strategy; preserving and protecting biodiversity; and towards zero pollution for a toxic free environment. For the purposes of this report, targets were drawn from policy documents covering the EGD time frame from December 2019 to mid-2024. The analysis focuses on quantifiable targets with thresholds to be achieved within a specific deadline. However, insights are also provided on broader objectives such as those in the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, and the Sustainable Food System initiative. Commission services were extensively consulted, and 11 Directorates–General provided feedback (see acknowledgements). The European Council, at its meeting in June 2024, reaffirmed the commitment of the European Union to ensuring the success of the green transition. Building on the “early assessment” of progress towards the targets proposed in this report, scientists at the JRC will continue to explore opportunities, address existing and emerging gaps, and consider the challenges facing the EU in achieving this transition. The JRC will also focus on identifying solutions, enabling conditions and best practices to support the successful implementation of the European Green Deal. This work aims to inform future EU policies and initiatives for a sustainable, fair, just and climate-neutral Europe. 5INTRODUCTION \" Where does the The European Green Deal (EGD) sets out Europe’s strategy to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, European Union stand including a 2030 target of reducing net greenhouse regarding its Green Deal Gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% compared to ambitions in 2024? 1990. In February 2024, the European Commission (EC) What progress is still recommended an additional intermediate target of 90% by 2040. The EGD outlines a detailed roadmap for achieving needed? sustainable development in Europe [1]. The EGD ambitions are closely linked to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. The EGD and SDGs share common objectives that address major environmental sustainability concerns, whilst ensuring maximum social and economic sustainability. It is widely recognised that the transition towards sustainability requires systemic solutions. All-encompassing approaches need to be evaluated from a broad perspective, integrating environmental and socio-economic considerations. This means simultaneously stimulating innovation, competitiveness, resilience and job creation, while ensuring that the underlying socio-economic systems respect our planetary boundaries. There is increasing evidence (such as the 8th Environment Action Programme and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC reports) indicating that EU and global production and consumption patterns are unsustainable [2], and that several planetary boundaries are being surpassed. This exacerbates the planetary crises of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss [3], [4], [5]. Actions to foster green, just and inclusive transitions are essential for achieving EGD ambitions. Such actions require close cooperation between science, society and policymaking. Policies based on robust scientific evidence and citizen involvement can significantly contribute to the Green Deal’s environmental, social and economic objectives. This report focuses on the contribution of science. Scientific evidence can provide an assessment of the current status and expected evolution of the EGD targets. It can identify the main barriers and limitations to implementation, and possible solutions that might accelerate progress towards sustainability. As a contribution to this process, this report assesses the \"distance to targets\" to identify areas where urgent effort is needed to achieve the overarching EGD ambitions, stay within planetary boundaries, and advance towards the SDGs. The analysis is based on consolidated data and integrates the best available knowledge (within and outside the JRC), making sense of, filtering and distilling the vast amount of information available from many sources. This initial analysis quantifies progress towards goals and targets across seven EGD domains: 1) climate ambition, 2) clean, affordable, and secure energy, including building and renovating in an energy- and resource-efficient way, 3) industrial strategy and circular economy, 4) sustainable and smart mobility, 5) greening the Common Agricultural Policy and the Farm to Fork Strategy, 6) preserving and protecting biodiversity, and 7) zero-pollution 6and toxic-free environment, addressing impacts and benefits within and beyond EU borders. All EGD policy initiatives have been screened to extract the underlying quantifiable targets for each domain. The results presented in this report focus on progress towards EGD goals and targets, to help understand where the European Union stands now with regard to these targets. The report highlights the achievements of recent years and identifies the areas where further efforts will be required by the EU and Member States in the coming years. This assessment of status and trends towards EGD targets is necessary to identify implementation challenges, opportunities and barriers to reaching EGD goals. It will help to pinpoint enablers, synergies and trade-offs. The next steps will include the identification of gaps, as well as good practices and success stories emerging from policy design and implementation so far. The JRC will also consider other cross-cutting elements that are key for achieving EGD targets and fostering the green transition, including understanding and respecting planetary limits, digital technologies, Earth Observation, research and innovation, sustainable and green finance, and ensuring a just transition. Overall, this work aims to provide an early assessment for benchmarking progress. Consequently, it can offer scientifically based guidance on future programmes, areas of intervention and policies. 7METHODOLOGY General Overview Assessing progress towards implementing the European Green Deal (EGD) is complex. The EGD encompasses several policy initiatives across thematic areas, each with numerous targets. Additionally, different policy documents may share common targets. As the EGD agenda is still being implemented, this integrated assessment report should not be considered an ex-post policy evaluation. Rather, it is a stocktaking exercise, relatively early with respect to some targets, aimed at assessing the current status with respect to these targets. For this purpose, EGD policy initiatives were screened, and their underlying policy targets were extracted and organised by thematic areas into a database. The targets were further grouped by topic, constituting the base for various thematic fiches, which were then distributed among experts at the JRC. The experts validated the selection of targets to ensure an accurate, sound and robust selection. Furthermore, based on the most recent data available from in-house and acknowledged scientific research, they helped identify relevant indicators to assess the current status with respect to EGD ambitions. The resulting thematic fiches provided the knowledge foundation for this report. Additional information gathered from fiches (and related to policy socio-economic aspects, challenges to implementation and global implications) will be important in shaping the follow-up of this report. Policy targets and current status To understand the current status regarding EGD ambitions, a comprehensive analysis of EGD policies was conducted to derive overarching ambitions, targets, timelines, and benchmarks. Starting from documents available on the EGD website, the JRC analysed over 400 items (legal acts, communications, preparatory documents, staff working documents, factsheets, and reports). Considering only policy initiatives present in the Legislative The harmonisation of the distance- Train Schedule website under the EGD priority, 127 to-target assessment was crucial for EGD-related policy documents were identified, from aggregating results coherently across which the targets were extracted1. The assessment thematic areas. The assessment was does not consider targets related to policies adopted classified into four categories reflecting before the EGD, as the status of their implementation progress: falls outside the scope of this work and is covered by other reporting exercises, such as the Environmental \"on track\" (the pace of progress is Implementation Review for environmental policies. sufficient to reach the target value); In this report, the selection of targets has been refined \"acceleration needed\" (to reach according to three inclusion criteria: targets that define the target value); a specific value (numerical or semantic), that set a specific timeline, and whose objective is quantifiable. \"not progressing (the current trend This process resulted in the identification of 154 runs counter to the desired direction targets extracted from 44 key policy documents. or it is stagnant); Targets have been organised according to the seven thematic areas of the Green \"cannot be assessed\" due to lack Deal (as reported in the Annex to the EGD of data. Communication)2. Their legislative nature is also considered: 87 targets (56%) are legally binding (from 1 The analysis did not consider “blocked” and withdrawn initiatives. As mentioned in the Legislative Train Schedule website, “blocked” are the “proposals proceeding slowly or stalled”. Last update: 30 June 2024. 2 The seven EGD thematic areas are: 1) Climate ambition; 2) Clean, affordable and secure energy, including building and renovating in an energy and resource efficient way; 3) Circular economy; 4) Sustainable and smart mobility; 5) Greening the Common Agricultural Policy / Farm to Fork Strategy, 6) Preserving and protecting biodiversity; 7) Towards zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment. 8directives and regulations), 20 stem from proposals for directives or regulations (still in the policy cycle process or with provisional agreements reached), and 47 targets are extracted from communications. Targets which are not strictly quantifiable have been reported in the Annexes, which also contain extended assessments of trends, indicators, data sources, related figures and future projections, where available. The analysis of the targets capitalised on JRC expertise across various domains, engaging many JRC scientists in a collaborative and trans-disciplinary exercise. The analysis also provides an important overview of data gaps, which is essential for informing future assessments. Additional overarching aspirational objectives are presented in thematic focuses, beyond the colour-coded assessment, to provide a more comprehensive picture in thematic areas 3 (Circular economy), 4 (Sustainable and smart mobility), and 5 (Greening the Common Agricultural Policy and the Farm to Fork Strategy). Specifically, the thematic focus in area 3 concerns the Circular Economy Action Plan overarching objectives, in alignment with other reporting exercises (e.g. the 8th Environment Action Programme by the EEA). The thematic focus in area 4 provides a snapshot of milestones set by the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, indicating the current status towards achieving the sector’s decarbonisation. The thematic focus in area 5 provides an overview of relevant aspects contributing to a more sustainable EU food system capitalising on ongoing efforts by the JRC and EC services. Implementation challenges Several implementation challenges might hinder the achievement of EGD policies. This analysis encompasses a knowledge synthesis exercise to highlight the most prominent ones, as identified by several reporting mechanisms by the EC, as well as sectorial studies and reports by EU institutions and bodies. The EC reporting mechanisms reviewed and integrated into the assessment are: - The Environmental Implementation Review (EIR) 2022 [6] for all thematic areas; - The EU 2023 assessment of the National Energy and Climate Plans [7] for thematic areas 1 (climate ambition), 2 (energy), 4 (mobility), 5 (food system), 6 (biodiversity), 7 (pollution); - The Common Agricultural Policies Strategic Plans [8] for thematic area 5; - The EC 2023 Recommendation on the National Support Programmes for Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning [9] for thematic area 4; - The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change's 2024 Climate Neutrality Progress Report [10] for thematic areas 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Moreover, this report highlights implementation challenges at the sub-national level by considering sectorial scientific literature on the EU Mission on 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 [11], the EC Ninth Cohesion Report [12], and the Committee of the Regions' (CoR) reports on the Status of Regions and Cities 2023 [13] and EGD implementation report 2023 [14] in several thematic areas. For thematic Area 3 (circular economy) these reports were also considered: the European Court of Auditors Special Report 17/2023 on Circular Economy, the EEA Report 13/2023 on Accelerating the circular economy in Europe and the EEA's European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use, requested by the EC, focusing on the implementation of circular economy policies and highlighting good practices at the Member State level. 9Framing the research Some clarifications on the approach adopted to prepare this report are outlined as follows. - The effects of certain policies that have recently come into force will only become evident in the coming years. Furthermore, in some cases, indicators for new targets still need to be agreed upon. This analysis is limited to providing a snapshot of the present status of target implementation (when data are available) and does not evaluate the policies themselves. - The number of targets per thematic area does not necessarily reflect their relative importance. The number of targets depends on various factors, such as the number and granularity of articles in the policy documents, the type of policy document, and the nature of the topic. Therefore, the distance to target assessments provided in the infographics represent only a numerical and statistical overview. They do not account for the relative influence of targets in terms of their socio-economic or environmental impacts. Addressing these limitations would require further research and advanced modelling, as well as systematic follow-up studies. While these aspects are beyond the scope of this report, they could be explored in future research efforts to enhance the assessment. - Targets were extracted from various legal acts (regulations, directives, proposals for regulations and directives, and communications) issued after the European Commission's Communication on the European Green Deal (11 December 2019). For the purpose of this report, which focuses on assessing progress towards targets, specific manufacturing or production requirements for certain products were excluded (e.g. the ‘Deforestation Free Product’ Regulation and the Zero Emission Vehicles benchmark targets), as these do not have a defined time frame for achievement. Similarly, requirements addressing specific groups of stakeholders (e.g. economic operators) were also excluded. - Targets from communications were included in the analysis, despite their non-legally binding nature. Their inclusion is important in order to have a comprehensive picture of the EGD ambitions across all thematic areas, especially in those with limited legislation with quantifiable targets (e.g. food system and biodiversity). Furthermore, targets from communications are often used as references in several monitoring systems currently in place or under development (e.g. the Zero Pollution Monitoring and Outlook and the Biodiversity Dashboard). - Targets from communications that have not been adopted by a proposal (e.g. certain hydrogen-related targets from the ‘REPowerEU’) were also included in the assessment. Additionally, two targets common to different thematic areas (regarding the use of pesticides and organic farming, mentioned in both the 'Farm to Fork' and Biodiversity strategies) are acknowledged in their respective chapters and factsheets, but are counted only once in the overall statistics. The assessment of the progress towards the targets is based on the data and knowledge available until July 2024, while the legislative process of policies and their respective targets has been updated as of December 2024. 10METHODOLOGICAL FOCUS A pragmatic approach to include the multitude of diverse targets and objectives under the EGD The targets associated with the EGD and Therefore, the approach used in this report for assessed in this analysis are heterogeneous assessing progress – the traffic light system and differ in nature (e.g. quantitative or - assumes in certain cases a linear trajectory non-quantitative, binding or non-binding, relative to the progress towards policy objectives. sector-specific or general), and may change This approach is inspired by scientific literature depending on the evolution of policies. and other distance to target exercises (e.g. the Eurostat's assessment of SDGs achievement, Due to the intrinsic interlinkages among many EEA's review of the 8th Environment Action targets across different policies, interventions Programme and the European Scientific Advisory might impact their achievement, by either creating Board on Climate Change 2024 report).

Modelling such scenarios is beyond the scope of this report due to the complexity of the targets and policy objectives, which require numerous assumptions. 11The European Green Deal © by Grecaud Paul / stock.adobe.comFACTS AND FIGURES The European Green Deal (EGD) is the EU’s ambitious strategic blueprint to tackle the global climate crisis. Its goal is to transform Europe into a climate-neutral continent by 2050, laying out a detailed roadmap to achieve sustainable development across the EU. With an unprecedented suite of new policies and amended legislations across seven thematic areas, the initiative provides a holistic integration of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It aims to ensure that no one is left behind as Europe progresses towards the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Both the EGD and SDGs frameworks share common objectives, reflecting a strong commitment to address climate change and environmental challenges while maintaining a balance with societal and economic needs in a just and inclusive manner. In essence, the EGD aims to build a comprehensive and evolving policy framework that drives progress towards a green and prosperous EU. By setting clear targets and mobilising significant investments, the EU is taking concrete steps towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. However, achieving the EGD's goals requires a significant shift in current economic, governance, lifestyle, and behavioural paradigms [2], [15]. While the legislative framework is in place to achieve at least a 55% net reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, the rapid implementation of policies and measures at the Member State level is crucial for realising this target. Significant changes in EU energy production and consumption, alongside a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices across all sectors of the economy, are necessary. The success of the Green Deal hinges on the effective implementation of its comprehensive policies and the commitment of all EU Member States to work towards the common goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. This collective effort is essential for ensuring the success of the green transition. Given the broad range of initiatives linked to the EGD, many of which are approved or under negotiation according to the Legislative Train Schedule, it is essential to provide a comprehensive snapshot of where the EU stands with the set ambitions. This snapshot serves as a critical benchmark to track future progress against the EGD goals, identify areas requiring further attention, and ensure continued commitment from the EU Member States to the climate and sustainability objectives. With a similar approach – but a limited set of indicators – the Statistics for the European Green Deal dashboard by Eurostat was launched. In this context, the JRC is conducting a systematic analysis of policy targets under the EGD framework. A total of 154 targets across all key EGD domains have been identified, and their current implementation status is being assessed. The results are synthesised in the infographic on the following page. Considering all the targets (see Methodology), the general picture indicates that: - For 32 targets the EU is well on track to meet its ambitions - For an additional 64 targets, a positive trend is detected but the pace needs to accelerate to meet the ambitions. - 15 targets are not progressing and show a reversing or stagnating trend. - For the remaining 43 targets, no data is available for their assessment yet. 13This trend is confirmed when looking only at the binding targets, which constitute 56% of the overall number of targets. In this case, the EU is already on track to meet the ambitions in 13 targets (15% of binding targets). A positive trend is detected for an additional 29 targets (33%), although the pace should accelerate to meet the ambitions. For the remaining binding targets, 14% show no progress and 38% have insufficient data available to assess the trends. While there is a positive trend to acknowledge, it is important to note that, as of mid- 2024, more than half of the assessed targets require an accelerated pace to achieve the policy ambitions. The recently agreed ambitious legislations, especially the 'Fit for 55 package', are expected to yield results in the coming years. Meanwhile, it is important to monitor areas where data indicates stagnating or reversing trends to address these issues effectively and enhance efforts. Furthermore, increased ambitions or targeted policy interventions might be needed in specific areas to ensure consistency with the overarching goal of reducing net GHG emissions by 55%. Implementation challenges and barriers might hinder progress, and further work is being conducted to identify and develop solutions that support effective policy implementation in the EU. The EGD and the Sustainable Development Goals The ambitions of the EGD are closely linked to the SDGs and support the achievement of most of the goals [16], [17]. Strong connections between the EGD priority and the 2030 Agenda [18] have emerged using the JRC SDG Mapper tool1 to map all the EGD- related policy documents (retrieved via the European Parliament's Legislative Train website, without considering initiatives which were not tabled, blocked, or withdrawn) to the SDGs. Specifically, Figure 1 shows the goals and targets mostly addressed by the EGD policies2. The main SDG related is number 13 on Climate Action. Other relevant goals resulting from the textual analysis are SDG 7 on clean and affordable energy, SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production, SDG 15 on sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, tackling biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, and SDG 9 on sustainable industries and innovation. Moreover, the targets extracted from EGD policy documents were assessed to verify how they contribute to specific SDGs targets. The ongoing analysis reveals a strong correspondence between EGD policy targets and the SDGs, addressing 11 goals and 41 UN targets. A more detailed assessment of the relationship between the EGD policies and SDGs will be explored in further JRC work. This will highlight how achieving EGD policy targets contributes to integrating the 2030 Agenda into the EU and how interlinkages among targets may occur. 1 The SDG Mapper tool is an open-source web-based application that utiliszes text-mining techniques to detect relevant keywords and identify semantic links between the text and the UN 2030 Agenda. It helps users map any document with the SDGs on both goal and target levels [19]. The tool is available in the KnowSDGs platform. 2 The keywords can be target specific or more general at a goal level. For example, for the SDG13 the targets are very specific and most of the keywords detected in the policy documents refer to the main goal in general (i.e. “climate change” and “climate neutrality”). 14Figure 1. SDG goals and targets in the EGD policy documents, by number of keywords detected. Note: the big bubbles represent the SDGs and the smaller bubbles inside refer to the sub-targets. The size of the bubbles depends on the number of keywords detected for each SDG goal and target.

In 2023, the EU adopted a set of proposals to make the EU’s climate, energy, transport, and taxation policies fit for reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The ‘European Climate Law’ and amended Regulation on LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry) also recognised the need to enhance the EU’s carbon sink.

The FuelEU Maritime initiative was adopted in July 2023 and will come into effect on 1 January 2025. 23THEMATIC FOCUS Member States projections and EU Reference Scenario The progress assessment in this chapter compares specific targets with the projected outcomes for the target year, such as a target of -62% reduction in EU ETS emissions by 2030 against a projected reduction of 55-59%). These projections are based on Member States’ reporting to the EEA in 2023 under Article 18 of the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation (the EU-wide aggregate of these projections is published by the EEA, most recently in 2023). These projections include a with-existing- measures and a with-additional-measures version, reflecting Member States' views on the impact of their policies. However, the same projections are not mutually coherent at the EU level. For instance, they do not accurately project the evolution of emissions regulated at the EU level, such as the ETS and the CO 2 standards for road vehicles. Coherent EU-wide projections are published by the Commission, notably in the EU Reference Scenario, which is updated periodically and used for the analysing the impact of new policy proposals. This scenario addresses individual policy instruments at the appropriate administrative level (EU-wide or Member State) while striving to maintain as much detail as possible for the policies put in place by the Member States. This constitutes the most appropriate analytical framework for assessing the existence of implementation gaps against future EU targets. However, the most recent Reference scenario (Ref. 2020) was developed before the Fit for 55 package and provided the baseline for its impact assessments. Therefore, it is not fit for the purpose of this assessment.

For this reason, only nine targets have State levels. Where available, historical trends, data been isolated for this area, setting clear trajectories for sources and future projections are reported in Annex 1. GHG reduction and contributions by sectors to reach BINDING TARGETS Targets Assessment The at least 55% economy-wide net reduction objective is enshrined in the Climate Law as an overall ambition at the EU level. Specific legislation covering different sectors translates this into sectoral ambition levels which cumulatively achieve the -55% target. This corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 62% in the existing ETS compared to 2005, a 40% reduction in ESR, (this is now complemented by 42% reduction target compared to 2005 in the newly established ETS2). With the aim of ensuring strong emissions reduction in other sectors, the overall contribution of the LULUCF sector to EU’s economy-wide target of − 55% by 2030 is limited to a maximum of − 225 MtCOe/year. Achieving the LULUCF sector target of -310 2 MtCOe in 2030 will elevate the total EU GHG emission reduction to approximately 2 57% compared to 1990. The total net EU greenhouse gases emissions, including LULUCF, were reduced by 32.5% between 1990 and 2022 [21]. GHG emission reductions need to double in the current decade compared to the previous decades (see charts in the annexes). According to the Member States’ own projections reported in 2023 under Article 18 of the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation, total EU emissions are expected to fall in 2030 by about 50% below the 1990 level when factoring in additional measures. This falls short of the at least 55% objective, but the Member States projections do not accurately capture the evolution driven by EU-wide instruments such as the ETS. Reaching the -55 % objective further depends on delivery of ESR, which is not fully Reduce by at least 55% net GHG emissions compared on track, as well as the related functioning of ETS2. In addition, the -55% objective to 1990 levels, by 2030 assumes that the LULUCF sink is at least -225 MtCO 2e. The agreed LULUCF commitment of -310 MtCOe could even achieve -57%. However, the current 2 (Intermediate 2040 Climate Target) development of the LULUCF sink is opposite to the targets, including natural Achieve climate neutrality by 2050 disturbances that are expected to further increase with the ongoing climate change 'European Climate Law' [27], [28]. If this negative development continues, the risk of not reaching the sink of –225 MtCO cannot be ruled out. 2 On the other hand, the implementation of the complete Fit for 55 legislative package is expected to reduce EU net greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2030, putting EU on track to exceed 2030 targets [29]. On the way to climate neutrality by 2050, the Commission adopted a Communica- tion [23] in February 2024 that launches the process of setting the 2040 climate target for the EU, in compliance with Art. 4.3 of the Climate Law. While 2040 targets are not yet set, it is clear that much of the transition to 2050 has to be realised by 2040. Based on the recommended emission reductions of 90-95 % by 2040 compared to 1990, of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change advised, the Commission has recommended a net 90% GHG reduction target for 2040. Both 2040 and 2050 targets require a much deeper transformation of the energy system, through large scale deployment of climate-neutral technologies that require high investment efforts with some technologies not yet deployed at market scale. While some of the current instruments will keep delivering reductions well beyond 2030 (notably the EU ETS but also CO standards for vehicles, ReFuelEU Aviation, 2 FuelEU Maritime and the Fluorinated gas (F-gas) Regulation), there will be a need to review, update and complete the legislative framework for the post-2030 period. This will include topics such as carbon capture, industrial carbon removals, and overall and sector specific emission reduction trajectories. In addition, larger emis- sion reductions in difficult-to-abate sectors like agriculture will be needed, along with a larger role for carbon removals, including utilising land as a carbon sink.

Since 1 January 2024, it has been expanded to include the maritime sector [30]. The 2023 greenhouse gas emission projections reported by the Member States to the EEA [15], [22] result in a reduction of ETS emissions of 55% to 59% (with existing measures – with additional measures projection) in the ETS sectors in 2030. While these projections are short of the 62% target, it is important to note that, the ETS being an EU-wide market-based (cap and trade) instrument, this objective is not directly addressed by Member States specific policies and cannot be consistently and comprehensively covered by the individual Member States GHG emission projections. Given that the ETS instrument is established and operational, and that the nec- essary technologies are both available and affordable, it is anticipated that the target can be achieved. ETS2. Contribution of the buildings and road transport The ETS2 is a new EU-wide cap-and-trade economic instrument that covers the sectors of 43% emission reductions by 2030 CO emissions from the combustion of fuels in road transport, buildings, and 2 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a other sectors (mainly smaller industries), excluding agriculture. Monitoring starts combined cost-efficient contribution of 42% emission in 2025, with cap and trade applying from 2027. As such, it overlaps significantly reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 with the ESR in terms of sectors covered, but important differences are that a) it is Directive (EU) 2023/959 implemented at the EU level, rather than through Member State-specific policies, and b) it does not cover non-CO emissions, many of which are from the hard-to- 2 tackle agricultural sector. Between 2005 and 2022, the emissions covered by the ETS 2 fell by 16% according to own estimates of the JRC.

Progress in the transport and building sectors faces different challenges. While transport emissions are regulated by EU-wide CO emission standards for vehicles 2 (which have a relatively fast turnover rate), renovating the building stock is a more challenging effort, primarily driven by Member States' policies. Therefore, Member States' projections for building emissions significantly lag behind the expected cost-effective rate of reduction [31]. Overall, EU emissions in the sectors covered by the ESR, according to 2023 Member States projections, are expected to fall by 27-32% (with existing and ad- ditional measures, respectively) by 2030 compared to 2005, i.e. 8 -13 percentage points below the 40% target for 2030, with only 6 Member States projected to (over-) achieve their targets [22]. Absolute emissions in the agriculture sector have stagnated since 2010, while agricultural aggregate output has increased, decreasing emission intensity of EU agricultural products by 13%. Concerning emission reductions, current Member States' projections under the Governance Regulation foresee 2030 emissions with existing measures to be 373 MtCOe (or -3% compared to 2021) and 359 MtCOe (or -7 %) with additional 2 2 measures. The 2030 ‘MIX (55 Euro/t COe)’ scenario, used to assess the Fit for 55 2 targets corresponds to a -7 % decline in the agricultural sector by 2030 compared to 2021, aligning with the Member States ‘with additional measures’ scenario. The current (2023-2027) CAP aims to contribute to climate mitigation, with Member State strategies outlined in their Strategic Plans. Estimates of the CAP 2023-2027 impact on emissions require detailed information on the implementation and effectiveness of farming practices from the CAP instruments, which are currently being evaluated.

LULUCF Regulation In 2020, the gap between the reported LULUCF emissions in 2016-2018 and the target of -310 MtCOe for 2030 was -42 MtCOe for the EU. 2024 shows that this 2 2 gap has now widened: instead of -42 MtCOe, the EU needs to improve its LULUCF 2 sink by -80 MtCOe between 2022 and 2030 to meet the targets. The LULUCF 2 targets will be difficult to achieve unless substantial changes in forest manage- ment are implemented very soon. No debit rule.

However, acceleration is 2 An EU Strategy to reduce methane emissions needed to reach at least a 35% reduction by 2030. The largest source of methane emissions in the EU is the agriculture sector, accounting for more than half of the total emissions, followed by the energy and waste sectors. Within agriculture, almost all methane emissions are from livestock: 80% of the total stems from enteric fermentation and 18% from manure man- agement. Furthermore, the energy sector showed the highest decline in emissions, primarily due to the mitigation of fugitive emissions from fuels, including emis- sions from the extraction of solid fuels and those associated with oil and natural gas production and distribution. Most methane emissions from the waste sector come from solid waste disposal. GHG Emissions 27Implementation challenges Note: This section reports on the main challenges to implementing the Climate Ambition targets. It is based on extensive review of the Environmental Implementation Reviews, the Communication (and accompanying documents) on the ‘EU wide assessment of the draft updated National Energy and Climate Plans [7] and sectorial literature. Due to the transversal nature of the EU Climate Ambitions, many re- lated challenges are reported in other chapters. In particular, relevant challenges related to greening and securing the energy system (including energy efficiency in buildings) and the food system are addressed in thematic areas 2 and 5 respectively. This section will be expanded provid- ing a focus on selected enablers to possibly overcome challenges and boost the achievement of the Climate Ambition targets in the follow-up of this report.

THEMATIC FOCUS What other research shows about the EU Climate Ambitions A comprehensive, cross-cutting, and interdisciplinary approach is essential to effectively assess the EGD ambitions and verify alignment with set targets. Three recent reports are particularly noteworthy for their consensus on the assessment of EGD climate ambition progress: the 2023 \"Climate Action Progress Report” [15] by the EC, the 2023 \"Monitoring report on progress towards the 8th EAP objectives\" by the European Environment Agency (EEA) [2], and the 2024 report from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), \"Towards EU climate neutrality: progress, policy gaps, and opportunities\" [10]. These reports highlight a scientific consensus on the actual state of play regarding the implementation of targets, and collectively confirm the achievement of crucial objectives, while also indicating that there is still distance to cover towards the EGD policy goals and acceleration is needed in many fields. The Climate Action Progress Report confirms that EU net emissions decreased by 3% in 2022 compared to 2021, maintaining the 30-year downward trend since 1990. However, in line with this assessment, the report states that progress towards the EU climate targets is insufficient, and the pace of emission reduction should accelerate ‘considerably’ (p. 5) to meet the EU climate objective. This is also reflected in the Member States’ projections on CO2 equivalent removals in the LULUCF sector, which show that the ‘size of the carbon sink is continuing to decrease’ (p. 32), despite a slight increase in 2022 based on approximated data. The ESABCC report also urgently recommends that Member States implement national measures to increase the pace of emissions reduction and reverse the declining EU carbon sink in time. The EEA report aligns with these assessments, confirming that it is very unlikely that the EU will achieve the LULUCF targets, and that while the GHG emission reduction target by 2030 is possible, it remains uncertain. A ‘considerable acceleration in emission reduction’ and more than ‘threefold increase in the past 10-year average annual rate of net GHG emissions reductions’ are needed. Therefore, a significant increase in effort across all socio-economic sectors, particularly in the building and transport sectors, is required. This also includes implementing additional measures within the CAP to align with the 2030 target. 30Key messages The economy-wide objective of at least 55% net emissions reductions compared to 1990 is enshrined in the Climate Law, but there is a risk of falling short of this target. Based on the analysis of the data and trends, the pace of EU GHG emission reduction should increase considerably in the current decade compared to the previous decades to achieve the 55% net reduction target. Emissions reduction in the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sectors, which include domestic transport (excluding aviation), buildings, agriculture, small industry, and waste, are ongoing but still far from reaching the 40% reduction target in 2030. The agriculture sector needs to further reduce its non-CO GHG emissions to reach the ESR targets. 2 The revised LULUCF regulation sets a target of removing 310 MtCO e from the 2 atmosphere in 2030, but the long-term EU forest sink is moving away from this target. Natural disturbances are expected to increase with ongoing climate change, putting a strain on areas designated for carbon removal. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas contributor to climate change, with a larger global warming potential than carbon dioxide. The EU has expanded on global efforts to encourage increasing methane abatement both as an element of climate action and energy security support Acceleration is needed to reduce methane emissions in the energy, agriculture, and waste sectors, which account for almost all human-related methane emissions. Implementation of EU climate legislation is underway in Member States, but many challenges persist. Member States need to develop concrete pathways to reach their national net removal targets in the LULUCF sector and to address the gaps in the Effort Sharing Regulation sectors. The new EU Emissions Trading System will provide further incentives to reach the Effort Sharing Regulation targets. Fossil fuel subsidies remain a major obstacle to the EU climate ambitions and to the clean energy transition. As reported in the EU-wide assessment of the draft updated National Energy and Climate Plans [7], a collective effort by Member States is needed to set a clear timeline for their phase out. Implementation at local level is key for climate ambitions. Possible challenges in implementing GHG emission reduction targets include insufficient community engagement and low public awareness, regional disparities and urban-rural gaps, social risks especially for most vulnerable citizens, and misalignment between local and regional policies and national or EU-level strategies, preventing cohesive climate action. 3102 Clean, affordable and secure energyClean, affordable and secure energy Wind turbines in Patras, Greece Photo by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashClean, affordable and secure energy Factsheet The European Green Deal emphasises three fundamental principles to facilitate the transition to clean energy, aimed at cutting down on GHG emissions and improving citizens’ quality of life. These include guaranteeing a dependable and reasonably priced energy supply for the EU, creating a fully integrated, interconnected, and digitalised EU energy market, and giving priority to energy efficiency. This also involves enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings and cultivating a power sector driven by renewable energy.

The target is to be achieved jointly by all Member States, building on their RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413) coordinated and combined action. According to the EC assessment of the draft NECPs, the current drafts would lead to a share of 38.6-39.3% of renewables in the energy mix by 2030. Reaching the 2030 target of 42.5% (and even more so the aspirational target of 45%) will require a much faster growth in the coming years.

According to the Association of European Renewable Energy Research Centers (EUREC) [73], the EU’s industry is ready, in the right circumstances, to deploy innovative renewable energy technologies to a level likely to exceed 5%, including innovative technologies such as advanced photovoltaics, floating photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and solar thermal. Renewable energy in the power system Each Member State shall increase the share of Energy for heating and cooling makes up around half of the EU’s total gross final renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector by energy consumption. The annual average increases would lead to a target of at least 0.8 percentage points as an annual average 32.48% share by 2030. In 2022, the share of energy from renewables in heating calculated for the period 2021 to 2025 and by at and cooling continued to rise, with the EU average standing at 24.8%, up 1.8 least 1.1 percentage points as an annual average percentage points from 2021 (23.0%).

In absolute terms, the gross final consumption the share of renewable energy in the sector in 2020. of renewable energy for heating and cooling purposes in the EU has gradually RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413) increased over time, mostly due to the contribution of biomass and heat pumps. However, a major push is required to meet the 2030 target. Sweden led the way when it came to renewables in heating and cooling, with a 69.3% share, followed by Estonia (65.4%). Both countries use mostly biomass and heat pumps. They are followed by Latvia (61.0%), which relies mostly on biomass.

The year 2022 Directive (EU) 2023/1791 shows better results than in 2019, before the pandemic, when primary energy consumption was at 1354 Mtoe and 36.5% away from the target. The 1257 Mtoe registered for primary energy consumption in 2022 was the second lowest level since 1990 (the first year for which data are available), and the lowest was in 2020 (1236 Mtoe). According to the EC assessment of the NECPs, the current drafts would lead to a gap of 75 Mtoe from the 2030 target. . Member States are required to achieve cumulative The directive requires EU countries to set indicative national energy efficiency end-use energy savings from 2021 to 2030, targets based on final energy consumption contributions to meet the Union’s target. equivalent to new annual savings of at least 0.8% This requirement is cumulative, meaning that Member States must sustain the of final energy consumption in 2021-2023, at least annual savings achieved in one year over the following years, until the end of the 1.3% in 2024-2025, 1.5% in 2026-2027 and 1.9% in obligation period in 2030. 2028-2030. Member States can spread the savings over the obligation period, as long as they Directive (EU) 2023/1791 achieve the required cumulative amount of savings at the end of the period. The progressive increase is equivalent to a flat rate of 1.49% over 2024-2030, which is almost a doubling of the current ambition level. Each Member State shall ensure that at least 3% of According to SWD(2023)646, several Member States did not reach their annual the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings targets.

Despite its potential, cooperation joint projects with one or more other Member States between Member States has been very limited, thus leading to suboptimal for the production of renewable energy, subject to the results in terms of efficiency in increasing renewable energy. There are a few following: by 31 December 2030, Member States shall projects under consideration and being planned, as well as some permitting and endeavour to agree on establishing at least two joint under construction.

RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413) Energy Efficiency 40A target of 15% electricity interconnection for 2030 In 2021, 16 countries reported being on track to reach that target by 2030, or had RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413) already reached the target, but more interconnections are needed in some regions. Specifically, eight Member States have already met or are exceeding the EU target. Others commit in their draft NECPs to develop interconnections with neighbouring countries by investing in new transmission capacities and interconnectors, espe- cially in regions that are historically dependent on a single supplier and now aim to improve diversification. Moreover, some Member States (e.g. EE, FI, IT and PT) plan to diversify their energy mix by carrying out joint hydrogen infrastructure projects [7]. Overall, Member States have made good efforts to increase cross-border capacity and the completion of various Projects of Common Interest should further improve the interconnectivity levels. Some Member States (CZ, IT, PT RO, SI, SE) are reporting delays in the completion of the projects in particular due to permitting issues. Still further efforts are required to meet the 2030 objectives, especially in terms of timely delivery of the planned cross-border projects [72]. Energy Infrastructure Member States shall ensure that the contribution The use of renewable hydrogen in Europe was negligible up to 2023, including also of renewable fuels of non-biological origin used for in industrial processes. final energy and non-energy purposes shall be at least 42% of the hydrogen used for final energy and non-energy purposes in industry by 2030, and 60% by 2035.

An EU Strategy for Energy System Integration Renewable energy in the power system Reduce buildings’ final energy consumption by 14% The reference value for 2015 is 374.5 Mtoe. The final energy consumption (FEC) A Renovation Wave for Europe increased in 2021 to 391.2, value obtained from adding FEC from service and residential buildings (129.4 and 261.8 Mtoe). In 2022, the FEC decreased to 364.1 Mtoe, with 121.6 Mtoe coming from service buildings and 242.4 from residential buildings. Consumptions decreased by 2.8% in the 2015-2022 period. At least double the annual energy renovation rate of The weighted annual energy renovation rate in the EU is about 1%, rate should residential and non-residential buildings by 2030 and double to 2% to achieve the target. For residential buildings, the annual weighted to foster deep energy renovations energy renovation rate was estimated close to 1% within the EU (0.4-1.2% A Renovation Wave for Europe depending on the Member State), for the 2012-2016 period. As of 2021, the annual rate of deep renovation is only 0.2% for residential buildings and 0.3% for non-residential buildings. Data on renovation rates in the NECPR are highly incomplete, with only seven Member States reporting in this field in 2023. Energy Efficiency 41Double the current deployment rate of individual heat The deployment rate was 2.2 million heat pumps in 2021 and 3 million pumps, resulting in a cumulative 10 million units by in 2022. There are nearly 20 million heat pumps installed in the EU as of 2027 and 30 million units by 2030. 2022. The current rate is enough to reach the 2030 target. REPowerEU Reduce buildings’ energy consumption for heating and The reference value for 2015 is 234 Mtoe.

Consumptions increased by 5.6% (2015-2021), instead of reducing. Data for 2022 has not been published yet, however an estimate can be provided based on the 2015-2021 average share of services FEC for space heating and air conditioning to total services FEC (56%). 2022 FEC for space heating and cooling buildings = FEC for space heating residential + FEC for air conditioning residential (only electricity) + FEC for space heating and air conditioning services = 159.4 + 1.1 + 68.0 = 228 Mtoe. Consumptions expected to decrease by 1.3% (2015-2022). Reduce buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, In 2015 buildings direct GHG emissions were 541 MtCOe, therefore the 2 by 2030 (compared to 2015), and reach climate target value for 2030 is 216 MtCOe. 2 neutrality by 2050 European Climate Neutrality Observatory data shows past progress of 5 A Renovation Wave for Europe MtCOe between 2016 and 2021. To meet the target, the required annual 2 change between 2021 and 2030 needs to be 7.5 times faster than the past rate of progress. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU’s total energy consumption, and for 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions from energy (including indirect emissions). Buildings related emissions belonging to fossil fuelled district heating, electric heating and electricity use of heat pumps are covered by EU ETS, while the rest is covered by the ESR. Energy Efficiency Set up at least one renewables-based energy For the 2010-2021 period, energy communities in the EU were still a community in every municipality with a population niche in most national energy markets, with an estimated 9250 energy higher than 10.000 by 2025 communities currently in operation across the EU and highly unbalanced EU Solar Energy Strategy distribution among Member States.

Annual installation rate grew An EU offshore Renewable Energy Strategy from 1.2 GW/year to around 3GW/year. A substantial increase is required in annual installations to reach 60 GW by 2030 (about twice the increase rate). Additionally, Member States have agreed to a new more ambitious non-binding target of reaching 111 GW by 2030 and 317 GW by 2050. The strategy sets targets for an installed capacity of In 2023, the EU Member States installed in the order of 700 kW of at least 1 GW of ocean energy by 2030 and 40 GW ocean energy (compared to 150 kW in 2022) and the cumulative ocean by 2050 energy capacity in European sea basins is 43.8 MW.

A Hydrogen Strategy for a climate-neutral Europe Renewable hydrogen Implementation challenges Note: This section reports on the main challenges to implementing the Clean and affordable energy targets at Member State and local (sub-national) levels. It grounds on an extensive review of the Environmental Implementation Reviews (EIR), the Communication (and accompanying documents) on the ‘EU wide assessment of the draft updated National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) (COM(2023) 796) [7], and sectorial reporting. Due to the transversal nature of the topic, related challenges might also regard climate ambitions (Thematic Area 1). This section will be expanded providing a focus on selected enablers to possibly overcome challenges and boost the achievement of the Clean and Affordable energy targets in the follow-up of this report.

However, as also reported in the assessment of Energy for All Europeans packages. Increasing the draft NECPs, very few Member States provide concrete share of renewable energy in final energy consumption evidence of involving Local and Regional Authorities is vital, as envisaged by the binding target of 42.5% (LRAs) in drafting. The State of Regions and Cities in the REDIII (and the collective aim to achieve 45%). 2023 report confirms that LRAs in higher poverty areas According to the draft NECPs assessment by the EC, struggle with skyrocketing energy prices and high current projections show that the EU could reach inflation, which limit their ability to invest in sustainable between 38.6% and 39.3% in 2030.

The EU should repositories [77]. therefore promote these fuels in quantities that balance ambition with the need to prevent direct and indirect land use change. In the field of energy efficiency, the preliminary NECPs assessment unveils a substantial gap in achieving EU's 2030 energy efficiency targets for both primary and final energy consumption. Final NECPs will have to be more ambitious and indicate clear 44Key messages In recent years, the EU has accelerated its clean energy transition, diversified supplies, and focused on energy savings. Several energy targets are currently assessed as needing more acceleration following the increased ambition and raised binding targets for 2030. Achieving the new 2030 EU overarching target of 42.5% share of energy from renewable sources will require a significant investment in renewable energy infrastructure, scaling up the production of renewable hydrogen, and reinforcing Europe's power grids to integrate more clean energy. The Net-Zero Industry Act creates a regulatory framework that simplifies planning and permitting for renewables deployment while the EU Action Plan for Grids will expand and upgrade the EU power grids to accommodate the expected increase in electricity consumption and the growth in generation capacity of renewables. Wind and solar, which first surpassed fossil fuels in EU electricity generation in May 2022, further consolidated the trend in 2023. The EU has become a global leader in offshore wind, exporting equipment and expertise around the world. Nevertheless, there is a need to accelerate investment in offshore wind, as well as ocean energies, to meet the 2030 targets. Solar is the fastest growing energy source in the EU. Acceleration is needed to uptake renewable hydrogen in industry and transport by 2030, as well as to create an optimum and dedicated infrastructure for hydrogen, and an efficient hydrogen market. The latest Energy Efficiency Directive revision established ‘energy efficiency first’ as a fundamental principle of EU energy policy, meaning that energy efficiency must be considered by EU countries in all relevant policy and major investment decisions taken in the energy and non-energy sectors.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY Policy context Resource extraction and processing globally Raw Materials Act [46] and the Battery Regulation [84]. have contributed to half of total greenhouse gas 2. A new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) [85], emissions and more than 90% of biodiversity adopted in 2020, sets out a policy agenda to establish loss and water stress [78]. Global consumption of a coherent sustainable product policy framework, to materials (i.e. biomass, fossil fuels, metals and minerals) reduce waste and to increase circularity in resource- is expected to double by 2060 [78], while annual intensive sectors, such as electronics, plastics and waste generation is estimated to increase by 70% buildings, while promoting resource consumption within by 2050 [79]. The amount of raw materials extracted planetary boundaries, both at EU and global level. to manufacture goods and services consumed in the EU reached 14.8 tonnes per capita in 2022, which is The EU Industrial Strategy approximately 22% above the world average [80]. It The EU Industrial Strategy, launched in March is expected that products and infrastructures needed 2020, aims to support the twin transitions to a for the twin transition will consume huge quantities of green and digital economy, boost the EU's global valuable resources, including critical raw materials, in competitiveness, and enhance strategic autonomy. the next decades [81]. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities of global value chains, emphasising the importance of To tackle those challenges, the production and a resilient EU Single Market. This prompted a targeted consumption systems should be transformed to update to the EU Industrial Strategy in May 2021 to keep materials in their highest value use for as address new challenges. To increase Single Market long as possible, to optimise products and asset, resilience and strengthen the EU's open strategic to minimise waste, and to ensure waste is recycled autonomy, measures to include monitoring the Single to a high quality. A strong and competitive EU clean Market across 14 industrial ecosystems and assessing tech industry is needed to deliver the technologies strategic dependencies from foreign suppliers. To and services required for the green transition. On the further accelerate the twin transition, action includes other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian co-creating transition pathways and investing in low- invasion of Ukraine have further illustrated the need carbon technologies through partnerships. Overall, the to improve EU value chains resilience and decrease strategy seeks to ensure Europe's industrial resilience, strategic dependencies. As part of this transformation, competitiveness, and sustainability in the face of public and private consumers have a key role to play, as evolving global challenges. they can make use of their spending power to influence market decisions. As such, the two main streams of The global market for key mass-manufactured policy actions in this area include: clean energy technologies will be worth around EUR 600 billion by 2030, while clean energy- 1.

This encompasses the newly not become bottlenecks in the future. Therefore, as presented Green Deal Industrial Plan [44], the Critical part of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the EC aims 50to create a predictable and simplified regulatory EU’s efforts to develop its own sustainable battery environment, accelerate funding access, enhance skills value chain were formalised in the 2018 Strategic and ensure fair trade. The Green Deal Industrial Plan Action Plan for Batteries and reinforced in the new includes initiatives, such as the Net-Zero Industry Act CEAP [85]. This plan aimed to increase EU’s industrial to support regulatory frameworks and financing, and to capacity in battery manufacturing by accelerating establish Net-Zero Industry Academies for up-skilling. efforts to access raw materials (including secondary), The Plan also focuses on strategic areas where the EU and by developing large-scale cell manufacturing and has dependencies, such as critical raw materials and battery assembly capabilities. These policy measures batteries [83]. have led to significant investment in this value chain with the EU expected to reach production capacity of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) are materials with up to 379 GWh by 2025 for battery cells, representing both a high risk of supply disruption and high around 70% of the expected EU demand for electric economic importance for the EU [46]. CRMs are vehicle batteries in 2025 [88]. generally metals, or minerals – non-food and non-fuel Building on the 2006 Battery Directive [89], the raw materials - supplied at the extraction, processing 2023 Batteries Regulation [84] under the new CEAP or recycling stages. Currently, the EU depends heavily will ensure that batteries sold on the EU market are on third countries for CRMs. For example, China sustainable, circular, well-performing, safe throughout supplies 100% of EU’s heavy rare earth elements and their life cycle and that materials used in batteries are Turkey provides 99% of EU’s supply of boron, both responsibly sourced. This includes service life, possible CRMs used in fuel cells, wind turbines, e-drive motors, second-life applications and high ambitions in terms among other technologies [81]. The Critical Raw of circularity (e.g. collection, removability, recycled Materials Act (CRMA) has taken root from the political content, recycling efficiency and recovery targets). The momentum after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, since legislation also introduces green public procurement the Versailles declaration [87] underlined the strategic criteria and information platform(s) for consumers importance of CRMs in guaranteeing the EU's open under due diligence requirements. This innovative strategic autonomy and sovereignty, as well as the legislation provides a life cycle approach, covering importance of strategic partnerships and stockpiling, many aspects of battery performance including criteria circularity and resource efficiency. on carbon footprint, consumer safety, and substances The CRMA leverages on the strengths and opportunities of concern. of the Single Market and the EU's external partnerships Furthermore, in July 2023, the EC proposed new to diversify and enhance the resilience of EU critical raw circularity requirements for vehicle design, production material supply chains. The CRMA focuses on supply and management of end-of-life vehicles, targeting in diversification and substitution and aims to improving particular plastics and rare earth elements in e-drive EU’s self-sufficiency and its capacity to monitor and motors. This proposal is expected to produce substantial mitigate disruption risks. At the same time, the CRMA environmental benefits, while increasing the recovery promotes sustainable raw material production and of critical raw materials through an improved system enhances circularity through an ambitious benchmark for vehicles collection and treatment. on the recycling capacity. Increased efforts to mitigate adverse impacts within the EU and in third countries A new Circular Economy Action Plan with respect to labour rights, human rights and Since the 1990s, several EU initiatives and legislation environmental protection are foreseen. For a subset have been introduced to address the sustainability of of critical raw materials, referred to as Strategic Raw products, either on mandatory (i.e. Ecodesign Directive Materials (defined in Article 3 and Annex I of the CRMA), for energy-related products) or voluntary basis (e.g. a set of quantitative benchmarks has been proposed, EU Ecolabel). The recently adopted Ecodesign notably concerning the EU's extracting, processing, for Sustainable Products Regulation [90] is a recycling capacity and supply diversification from third significant breakthrough as it establishes a countries to reinforce the EU industrial base. process to apply design and data requirements to a vast range of product groups placed on the Batteries are a key technology for the transition EU market, significantly improving the circularity (e.g. to a sustainable, secure and competitive EU durability, reusability, recyclability, recycled content), economy by enabling electric mobility, facilitating energy performance and other environmental aspects renewable electricity storage and supporting the of products. To ensure non-toxic loops (e.g. in the mobile digital transition. The global demand for production of some types of plastics and packaging batteries is expected to increase 14 times by 2030, with materials), the EC has adopted a recommendation the EU potentially accounting for 17% of that demand. establishing a European assessment framework 51for “safe and sustainable by design” chemicals and vehicles (see above), packaging, plastics, textiles, materials [91], which sets the ground for developing construction and buildings, and food, water and innovative chemicals and materials that are safer nutrients. Sectorial initiatives are currently at different and more sustainable, contributing to steer the sector policy development stages. For example, the EC is not only towards circularity, but also towards the currently assessing whether the existing Waste Electric minimisation of the use of substances of concern and and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive [97], which the impacts on the environment and human health sets out collection, recovery and recycling targets for (see also thematic area 7). WEEE, is still fit-for-purpose with results to be published by September 2024.

As such, in 2024, 2040 [85], while in 2021 packaging waste in the EU the EC adopted a Directive on empowering consumers reached 188.7 kg per inhabitant [99]. The EU’s efforts for the green transition [92], which amends the Unfair to tackle plastics’ pollution (e.g. single-use plastics Commercial Practices Directive [93] and the Consumer and microplastics) started before the EGD with policy Rights Directive [94] to ban commercial practices actions, such as the 2018 Plastic Strategy [100] and related to generic environmental claims (among the Single Use Plastics Directive [101]. The EGD and others), in addition to setting obligations for companies the CEAP have further reinforced this push towards to provide consumers with information on products’ more sustainability by: durability and reparability.

Double EU’s circular material use rate in the coming This target aims to increase the circular material use rate (CMUR) from 11.7% in decade 2020 to 23.4% in 2030. At the EU level, this target has been steady since 2010, A new Circular Economy Action Plan registering an increase of less than 1 percentage point [131]. As such, there is a stagnation in the pace of improvement of the CMUR indicator. At the Member State level, CMUR shows a high variability with values ranging from 0.6 to 27.5% in 2022.

Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles Sustainable carbon cycles 58Implementation challenges Note: This section provides a snapshot of major challenges associated with implementing this policy package, based on existing reports, such as the European Court of Auditors Special Report on Circular Economy [133], the EEA Report on Accelerating the circular economy in Europe. Under the EGD, the new CEAP has prompted several to the achievement of CE. First reporting on national innovative legislative and policy actions (e.g. programmes concerning the circularity of CRMs by Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation), as well 2026 (through the application of Art 26 of CRMA) will as the inclusion of CE principles in other EU policies be an interesting tool to benchmark Member States and strategic areas, such as the European Semester practices. process and the new Industrial Strategy. Nonetheless, currently several key legislative proposals still lack Monitoring progress can play a key role in informing political agreement and/or are waiting to be adopted and shaping future actions, as well as supporting by the co-legislators, for example End-of-Life Vehicles the implementation of CE policies. Currently, there Regulation and Environmental Claims Directive. In are several initiatives at both national and EU levels, addition, the EC is still evaluating whether the WEEE including the Circular Economy Monitoring Framework Directive 2012/19/EU [97] and Regulation 1257/2013 (CEMF) launched in 2018 by the EC. In 2023, the on ship recycling [134] are fit-for-purpose. Future EC CEMF was updated to better capture the production work on CE will also involve developing guidance and side of the economy and overcome monitoring gaps Delegated Acts to further support the implementation related to products. This update includes indicators of ESPR and the Batteries Regulation, among others. related to consumption and material footprints, and EU leadership and policy agenda on CE have been the the contribution of circularity to the EU's goals of main drivers to push for circular action at the Member open strategic autonomy. Despite this, there are still State level [135]. As such, potential future guidance challenges in comprehensively measuring CE progress, and updated legally binding circularity targets for especially related to lack or partial data related to key sectors (e.g. WEEE) can clarify strategic paths for certain aspects (e.g. CRM material flows), lack of Member State action. harmonised indicators and targets for monitoring and assessing circular practices [135], [136]. Most Member States now have CE strategies, roadmaps or action plans in place [135]. However, progress in increasing circularity has been slow and varied across countries [133], [135]. Putting in place policies is the first step towards transitioning to a circular economy; nevertheless, institutional challenges still exist at the Member State level, such as a lack of collaboration and coordination in developing coherent policies across responsible institutions/authorities and insufficient institutional knowledge and capacity to implement CE strategies in a systematic and effective way [136]. Due to the broad CE definition, Member States have approached circularity from different perspectives – some have prioritised waste management, whilst others focus on consumption [136] – leading to the development and implementation of measures, which will contribute to varying degrees 59THEMATIC FOCUS Progress towards the 2020 CEAP Ambitions Besides the targets extracted for the EGD progress assessment, the 2020 CEAP has put forward four non-binding and overarching ambitions to provide inspiration and guidance on implementing policies: (i) Decoupling economic growth from resource use; (ii) Reducing total waste generation; (iii) Reducing EU consumption footprint; (iv) Keeping EU resource consumption within planetary boundaries. Progress towards these ambitions is currently monitored under the EC's Circular Economy Monitoring Framework. The Material Footprint, measured in tonnes per capita, refers to the amount of material extracted from nature, both inside and outside the EU, to provide the goods and services consumed by EU citizens. On the other hand, the Consumption Footprint [132] refers to the environmental and climate impacts resulting from the consumption by EU citizens of goods and services, whether produced within or outside of the EU. The Consumption Footprint is based on life cycle assessment data for a basket of representative products, used to calculate environmental impacts across 16 impact categories, including climate change and resource depletion. The Material Footprint monitors the progress towards decoupling economic growth from resource use, while the Consumption Footprint can be used to monitor the progress towards reducing and keeping the EU Consumption Footprint within planetary boundaries. Figure 2 shows the evolution of Consumption Footprint, Material Footprint and total waste generation compared to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the decade 2010-2022. For the Material Footprint, the trend has increased slightly in the time frame 2010-2022 (+1.26%), while the economic growth (measured in real GDP) grew by 15% in the same period. In 2020, due to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Material Footprint fell by 4% compared to the previous year, but then increased back to pre-pandemic levels in 2021/2022. While some relative decoupling has been observed, achieving absolute decoupling appears improbable in the years, considering the relatively stable trend of the last decade. The generation of total waste increased by 5.4% in the time frame 2010-2018, and then dropped as a result of the pandemic- related economic slowdown in 2020. However, it reached again the 2010 levels in 2022 with percentage change of +0.9% in the overall period 2010-2022. Considering the 2010 level, the Consumption Footprint at the EU level has increased by 8.3% until 2022, showing a reverse trend with respect to the ambition set in 2020 CEAP. Similarly to the Material Footprint, the EU's Consumption Footprint fell by 5% in 2020 (compared to 2019 level), because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU faces a significant challenge in achieving a significant reduction of the Consumption Footprint by 2030. Furthermore, the EU Consumption Footprint exceeds the planetary boundaries (the quantitative estimation of the Earth’s carrying capacity, i.e. the “safe operating space for humanity”) in several impact categories, as shown in Figure 3. Despite the differences in the robustness of the various impact categories, these results show that for most categories the impacts are close to the threshold, when not already over it. For example, the climate change impact is eight times beyond the limit of the planet. 60Figure 2. Evolution of Consumption Footprint, Material Footprint and total waste generation compared to GDP (2012-2022). Note: The Consumption Footprint refers to the environmental and climate impacts resulting from the consumption by EU citizens of goods and services, whether produced within or outside of the EU; the Material Footprint (measured through the indicator Raw Materials Consumption, refers to the amount of material extracted from nature, both inside and outside the EU, to provide the goods and services consumed by EU citizens. The values of total waste generation for 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021 have been extrapolated.

The current legally binding targets (13) are those included in the Battery Regulation and in the Critical Raw Materials Act. For batteries, these focus on collection, material recovery, recycling efficiency and recycled content. For strategic raw materials, the targets address the diversification of suppliers and increasing the EU's extraction, processing and recycling capacities. Most quantifiable targets can be found in legislative proposals, which are not yet adopted (19). These focus on recycling and recovery of plastic and other packaging, food waste reduction and the circularity of end-of-life vehicles. Legally binding targets on the recycling and recovery of lead acid and nickel-cadmium batteries appear to be more achievable compared to other battery types. Progress on battery collection targets cannot be estimated, due to the lack of standardised calculation methods and recent data. Acceleration will be needed to meet the benchmarks of the recently adopted Critical Raw Materials Act for the EU extraction, processing and recycling capacity of strategic minerals, and to achieve supply diversification. Under the 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan, several policy initiatives have been proposed and/or adopted to improve the circularity and environmental performance of products, to protect and empower consumers against greenwashing and to increase repairability. However, most legally binding targets are still focused on recycling and material recovery, rather than waste prevention (e.g. reuse) and preparing for reuse (e.g. repair). As such, future legislative framework reviews and updates could consider this. The pace of progress is sufficient to achieve recycling targets for wood, ferrous metals, aluminium, glass, paper and cardboard packaging. Despite the results achieved so far, more effort is needed to meet the targets for packaging waste and food waste reduction as well as those for recycling and recycled content in plastic packaging. New policy measures, including possible new targets, may be needed to reduce the generation of waste electric and electronic equipment and construction and demolition waste or to improve the return of materials and products from these categories to the economy. No progress has been made to reduce EU's consumption footprint, keep EU resource consumption within planetary boundaries, increase the circular material use rate, or reduce waste generation (apart from that seen during the pandemic). Furthermore, little progress has been made on decoupling economic growth from resource use. Monitoring progress can play a role in supporting the implementation of circular policies. Therefore, improving data availability on material and waste flows, as well as harmonising indicators and targets for monitoring and assessing circular practices, is key. 6304 Sustainable and smart mobilitySustainable and smart mobility København, Denmark Photo by Steinar Engeland on UnsplashSustainable and Smart Mobility Factsheet The transport sector (including international aviation and maritime) is responsible for nearly 27% of Europe’s GHG emissions, the majority of which (76% in 2021) come from road transport.

The Euro 7 standards set new limits for emissions from cars, vans, and heavy-duty vehicles. Despite declining pollutant emissions due to stringent standards over the past 20-30 years, some unregulated pollutants like NH and N O have remained constant or 3 2 even increased. Stringent emission standards are crucial as there is no safe air pollution threshold.

This leaves 2018/2001 [39]. The GHG emissions savings from little space for an increased use of biofuels in the use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels has the road transport sector. RED III proposes stronger increased over time to 65% of GHG savings for plants sustainability criteria as well as a risk-based approach in operation after January 2021, in comparison to the capping the contribution of food-based biofuels to the fossil fuel comparator. Differently, the sustainability of targets to address the trade-off between the production RFNBO is set at 70% GHG emissions savings and the of biofuels and bioenergy and land use and land use calculation methodology is provided in a delegated act change.

To meet this target, RED III shifted the focus from a specific energy target to it is necessary to mobilise sustainable biomass, mostly emphasising emissions savings, establishing a target waste and residue feedstocks, and build additional of a 14.5% reduction in GHG intensity in transport and production capacity. Scaling up biomethane production a share of at least 29% renewables in the final energy capacity requires significant capital investments of used in transport. Electrification of road transport is key, almost EUR 70 billion on top of currently planned while biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological investments. Incentives for biomethane are essential origin contribute to decarbonise sectors, such as because it is more expensive than fossil natural gas, aviation and waterborne transport. RED III proposed a even if the EU ETS price is added. 71Assessment of progress towards the targets This section provides an overview of 24 targets directives, and targets from communications that are identified as relevant for this thematic area.

According to the of new heavy-duty vehicles European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) and Rabobank, the Regulation (EU) 2024/1610 whole EU bus fleet consists of around 715.000-750.000 vehicles, with city buses representing around 215.000 units (around 30%). Looking at city buses only, there has been a steady decrease in the number of new city buses fuelled by Diesel since 2016, increasingly being replaced by electric vehicles. A market growth average close to 18% could help achieve the 2030 target. This is feasible, given the 2020-2023 market trend (source: Rabobank). It should be finally noted that a collapse of the diesel buses market is unlikely (e.g. due to the need in rural areas), and new electrically chargeable buses accounted for 12.7% in the total EU bus market in 2022, making up only 1.4% of total buses on EU roads (source: ACEA).

In 2022 they were still 6% below 2019 levels. However, Eurostat quarterly GHG emission data shows that this rebound continued in 2023. According to the Report “Towards EU climate neutrality: progress, policy gaps and opportunities” by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change, the average rate of emission reduction since 2005 (-2 MtCOe per year) should be more than 10 times higher (-26 MtCOe 2 2 per year in 2023-2030) to be consistent with the trajectories towards the overall 2030 net GHG emission reduction target by the EU Climate Law. When considering the 90% reduction objective for transport GHG emissions by 2050, the average rate of emission reduction should be higher (-31 MtCOe in 2031-2050). 2 Zero-emission in urban logistics Although it has been estimated that urban freight is an important traffic The new EU Urban Mobility Framework component (10% to 15% of vehicle equivalent miles) and is responsible for 20% to 25% of urban transport related CO emissions [159], [160], there is no sufficient 2 data to assess the trend.

Fuel intensity in fisheries 75THEMATIC FOCUS Milestones towards a decarbonised transport In addition to the targets extracted for the progress assessment, the 2020 Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy outlines various Milestones. They are intended to “show the European transport system’s path towards achieving our objectives of a sustainable, smart and resilient mobility, thereby indicating the necessary ambition for our future policies”. Some of them, like the ones related to the hydrogen and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, have already been transposed into binding targets through legislation (e.g. the AFIR). These Milestones encompass aspects aimed at ensuring that transport becomes sustainable, smart, and resilient. The multimodal Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). According to the Strategy, it must be equipped and fully operational for sustainable and smart transport with high-speed connectivity for the core network by 2030. It is expected to be operational for the comprehensive network, by 2050. The state of implementation of TEN-T transport infrastructure at the level of the Core Network Corridors reached in 2017 between 81% and 100% for most (10 out of 13) of the available indicators, whereas for the remaining three requirements the compliance rates range from 11% to 67%. These compliance rates do not always fully reflect the reality in terms of the quality or operational functionality of the transport network and the real needs on the ground [171]. Nonetheless, a strong acceleration is needed to meet this Milestone and have the core network operating at full capacity by 2030 [172]. Directive 2021/1187 [162] acknowledges that different and complex permit-granting procedures, cross- border procurement procedures and other procedures result, in many cases, in significant delays and increased costs. The death toll for all modes of transport should be close to zero in the EU. This Milestone is in line with the UN Global Plan to reduce road traffic deaths by 50% by 2030, which was welcomed by the EC in October 2021. Road traffic deaths in the EU showed a decrease of 63% in the last 10 years, but in 2022 the fatalities increased by 4% compared to 2021, as traffic levels recovered after the pandemic. However, they remain below pre-pandemic levels. Additional efforts are needed to meet the 2050 milestone, as well as doubling the average annual fatalities pace to be in line with the UN Global Plan by 2030 [163]. 30 million zero-emission cars and 80 000 zero-emission lorries by 2030. This Milestone is also reflected in the Eurostat’s dashboard “Statistics for the Green Deal” (zero-emission vehicles: percentage of new vehicles registered in the year). The share of new electric vehicles registered in 2017 was 0.7% while it was 12.1% in 2022, with a percentage increase of more than 1600%. In 2022, the zero-emission (battery electric) vehicles represented 1.2% of the passenger car fleet in the EU, i.e. around 3 million zero-emission vehicles [164]. A fully operative charging infrastructure and additional measures, also at Member State level, are expected to accelerate what foreseen by the Strategy. Rail freight traffic to increase by 50% by 2030 and double by 2050 compared to 2015. The rail freight traffic, measured in billion tonne-kilometres (tkm), showed an increase of 2.8% in 2021 compared to 2015. High-speed rail traffic to double by 2030 and triple by 2050 compared to 2015. The trend of high- speed rail transport, in terms of billion passengers-kilometres (pkm), increased from 2010 until 2019 (+25% in 9 years) with a fall in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A small increase was registered in 2021. Transport by inland waterways and short sea shipping to increase of 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2050 compared to 2030. Considering the gross weight of goods transported (in thousand tonnes), it increased by 7.4% from 2015 to 2021, while it decreased by -9.8% in inland waterways. The cumulative thousand tonnes show an increase of 4.4% from 2015 to 2021. Additional Milestones foresee that scheduled collective travel for journeys under 500 km will be carbon neutral, automated mobility will be deployed at large scale, and zero-emission marine vessels will be market-ready by 2030. According to the Strategy, zero-emission large aircraft will also be market-ready by 2035. 76Implementation challenges Note: This section reports on major challenges to implementing the Sustainable and Smart Mobility targets. It grounds on critical reviews of the Environmental Implementation Reviews, Communication on the ‘EU wide assessment of the draft updated National Energy and Climate Plans (COM(2023) 796) [7], the Commission Recommendation on National Support Programmes for Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning [9], the SWD(2021) 470 for the New Urban Mobility Framework [165], and sectorial studies.

[168] in the implementations of transport policies, as also recommended by the EC [9]. Leuven, Belgium Photo by Tobias Cornille on Unsplash 78Key messages Reducing net GHG emissions by 90% will be highly challenging, considering the average rate of emissions reduction since 2005. Achieving this goal will require a reduction pace that is 10 times higher up to 2030. The recently adopted regulations ETS2, AFIR and CO₂ emission performance standards, as part of the Fit-for-55 package, will be key to achieving this goal. The successful decarbonisation of road transport requires a robust capillary infrastructure for alternative fuels. Renewable hydrogen and electric charger infrastructure deployment must accelerate. Based on available data, tripling the number of new electric charging stations compared to 2023 is required to meet the ambition of 3 million charging points. Currently, 60% of stations are installed in three countries only (Germany, France and the Netherlands). Member States are urged to implement the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation swiftly. Advanced sustainable biofuel and biogas will play their role in decarbonising the EU aviation and maritime transport sectors, progress in this area is sufficient to meet the requirements. Renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are a promising solution for these hard-to-electrify sectors, although the market is still developing. The recently adopted RED III and FuelEU Maritime are expected to boost this sector. Urban transport contributes to around 23% of the EU's transport-related GHG emissions. The electrification of the urban bus fleet is happening fast and the EU is likely to meet the target of 90% of new electric urban buses in 2030. However, electric buses still represent a small proportion of the entire EU fleet. Furthermore, the CO emissions from heavy-duty vehicles must decrease more rapidly to meet 2 the ambitions. Increased efforts in promoting cycling, as outlined in the European Declaration on Cycling, can make a strong contribution to sustainable urban transport. The quality and accessibility of public transport must improve. The design and implementation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) is key, but effective governance, monitoring, and technical skills are needed. Member States should support urban areas in the implementation of SUMPs and links with national and EU funding schemes. Furthermore, data is missing in many trans- port-related areas (e.g. traffic, people flow, implementation of AFIR and pollution), these data are essential for the assessment of progress.Dienheim, Germany Photo by Karsten Würth on Unsplash 05 Greening the CAP ‘Farm to Fork’ StrategyGreening the CAP ‘Farm to Fork’ StrategyGreening the CAP | ‘Farm to Fork’ Strategy Factsheet The EU food system provides food to more than 450 million people in the EU and many more in the world while contributing to economic development and employment.

EMA). According to the 13th European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption report, the overall sales of antimicrobials for use in food-producing animals within the EU have fallen between 2018 and 2022 by 28.3%. During this period, the overall EU sales have thus reached more than half of the reduction target, which shows that the target can be achieved by 2030. Antimicrobials Reduce by 50% the use and risk of chemical Indicator: Use and risk of chemical pesticides (Source: DG SANTE). pesticides According to data published by DG SANTE, the use and risk of chemical pesticides Target in Common with Biodiversity Strategy (see decreased by 33 % between the baseline period of 2015–2017 and 2021. The Thematic Area 6) and Zero Pollution Action Plan (see use and risk of chemical pesticides shows a decrease of 6% from 2020 to 2021. Thematic Area 7) These overall downward trends show that the target can be achieved by 20301. [182] 1 It should be noted that the current EU-wide indicator, which applies risk weightings to four different groups of chemical pesticides and is based on pesticide sales, is not considered scientifically robust by some. This indicator is based on a similar harmonised risk indicator, which, according to the European legislation (Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782), is considered hazard-based. This is due to the absence of statistics on the use of plant protection products needed to develop a risk indicator. The Commission is committed to developing more sophisticated indicators in future, such as improved weightings that take hazard properties into account in a more granular way or by using EU-level data on pesticide usage when it becomes available. An example of such an improvement is the new risk indicator assessing the toxicity of pesticide residues in soil from samples collected under the LUCAS Soil Pesticide survey coordinated by JRC. According to this indicator, in 2018, 14% of sites in the EU were at risk of negative effects on soil organisms due to pesticide residues. The analysis of samples from 2022 is currently ongoing and will shed light on the EU’s progress towards pesticide risk reductions. This indicator is relevant to only one compartment (soil) but is just one of many being examined for usefulness and relevance. . Pollution 86Reduce by 50% the use of more hazardous pesticides Indicator: Use of more hazardous pesticides (Source: DG SANTE).

The use Thematic Area 7) of more hazardous pesticides shows an increase of 5% from 2020 to 2021. Achievement of the 50% reduction target by 2030 remains challenging. It should be noted that while this indicator intends to monitor the use of the more hazardous pesticides, it does not take into account the exposure and hence the impact they might have on the environment and human health. In the future, this indicator could be complemented with a risk indicator showing changes in the actual risks2. 2 Options include better grouping of substances, group weighting reflecting substances’ toxicities, standardisation of sales data with recommended application rates and utilisation of pesticide use data instead of the sales data as the basis for a new indicator Reduce nutrient losses by at least 50%, while ensuring Indicator: Nitrate in groundwater (Source: EEA). that there is no deterioration in soil fertility. The EU aggregate for nitrate content in groundwater based on 18 Member States shows a positive trend (–0.7% annual growth rate) between 2015 and 2020. However, this slight reduction is still far away from the 50% aimed by 2030. It should be noted that the long-term trend (2005-2020) for the EU aggregate was rather stagnant (0.003% annual growth rate).

Technology and digitalisation 87THEMATIC FOCUS A broader perspective. Selected indicators for additional food system domains In order to track progress, from a more holistic food system angle, this report also considers selected indicators related to additional domains relevant to the sustainability of the EU food system, in addition to the seven quantitative targets presented above. Such proposed indicators are derived from the Food System Monitoring Framework (JRC Publications Repository - EU food system monitoring framework. From concepts to indicators) and specific selected indicators are available on the EU Food System Monitoring Dashboard. GHG Emissions Ensure that agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and the food value chain contribute to the target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 and to the achievement of the objective for a climate-neutral Union in 2050. The trend (from 1990 to 2018) of this indicator for the EU 27 countries covering the GHG emissions from the entire food value chain (from production to consumption within the EU territory) is in the desired direction to contribute to the 55% net reduction and climate neutrality targets set by the EC for all economic sectors in the EU combined. However, the lack of current data, and the unpredictability of certain components of the GHG food system emission indicator (as temporal or geographical changes in LULUC), make the prediction to 2030 very uncertain. In 2018 (the last recorded year in the time series) the total EU GHG food system emissions represented 85.86% of the GHG food system emissions in 1990. Indicator: GHG food system emissions (Source: JRC EDGAR Food). Sustainable use of resources Water: Preserving freshwater, boosting water reuse in agriculture. Overall, using a 3-year moving average, the EU has seen a 14% improvement in the Water Exploitation Index (WEI+) compared to 2011. This improvement was observed in 14 Member States. However, further improvements are necessary. Efforts are needed to reduce the inequality in total water use as a percentage of the renewable freshwater resources between Member States, especially in the Mediterranean area. (Renewable freshwater resources in the WEI+ index are computed considering mainly a change in the water storage capacity (groundwater and surface water) of a given territory. For example, Cyprus had a WEI+ of 113% in 2019, in contrast to France's 2.8%. Seven Member States recorded a WEI+ score of less than 1, indicating that their water storage capacity exceeded their consumption. Indicator: Water use in agriculture (Water exploitation index, plus - WEI+) (Source: EEA). Aquatic living resources: Increase sustainable fishing and aquaculture. Bring fish stocks to sustainable levels. Significant increase in organic aquaculture. This is the objective of the CFP to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally sustainable and managed in a manner consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits. This indicator shows the modelled average ratio of fishing mortality to its associated reference point (FMSY or its proxy) over time since 2003. It monitors the trend of F/FMSY at the level of European waters (Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea). The aim is to have a decreasing trend (as the starting point was 1.56) and to reach the lowest possible level below 1. A downward trend was observed throughout the time series, thus showing an improvement in the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks. Although the indicator in 2021 stands at 0.88, lower values are expected in case of full sustainable exploitation since some stocks are still overfished (F>FMSY). Indicator: Fishing pressure relative to maximum sustainable yield (trends in F/ FMSY) (Source: JRC). 88Energy: Increase renewable energy in the agriculture and food sector. Adopt energy efficiency solutions in the agriculture and food sector, by reducing energy consumption. Overall, there has been an increase in energy consumption for both agriculture and forestry, as well as the overall food industry, by 7.4 % and 13.5% respectively compared to 2011. The annual rate of increase is 0.8% for agriculture and forestry and 1.7% for the food industry. Across Europe, these two sectors have consumed 54.32 million tonnes of oil equivalent, evenly split between them. France and Germany lead in total energy consumption. For the overall food industry, there has been a noticeable decrease of 1% in France, while Germany experienced an increase of 5.8% compared to 2011. In agriculture and forestry, France and the Netherlands lead in energy consumption, with increases of 1.3% and 9.9%, respectively. Consequently, efforts are required to enhance energy efficiency and achieve the objective of reducing energy consumption at the EU level. Indicator: Final energy consumption in agriculture, forestry and food industry (Source: Eurostat). Biodiversity Biodiversity conservation and restoration of natural resources: Protect the environment and restore natural resources. Preserve biodiversity and reduce biodiversity loss. The impacts on global species richness due to the supply chain of food products consumed in the EU (produced either in the EU or in other world regions) have increased during the last decade. This results from increasing food consumption, as well as increasing consumption of animal-based products. Main drivers of biodiversity loss are associated to land use and climate change impacts. Observed trends in consumption patterns are not expected to change to an extent to revert this trend by 2030. Indicator: Consumption Footprint - Food (biodiversity loss) (Source: JRC). Genetic biodiversity of food production systems: Secure and ensure access to a range of quality seeds for plant varieties in order to adapt to the pressures of climate change. The FAO progress assessment of SDG indicator 2.5.1.a, for the period 1995-2021, observes a global trend of improvement in Europe, with a slowdown in improvement particularly in the last five years. Indicator: Number of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture secured in either medium- or long-term conservation facilities (Source: FAO). Cross-cutting environmental Circular economy: Scale-up and promote sustainable and socially responsible production methods and circular business models in food processing and retail. No adequate indicator is available at the moment to assess this objective. Consumption footprint: Reduce the environmental and climate footprint of the EU food system, operating within planetary boundaries. Reduce the EU’s contribution to global deforestation and forest degradation. According to JRC study [183], the EU food system is transgressing several planetary boundaries including climate change and those related to novel entities (particulate matter, freshwater ecotoxicity). The Consumption Footprint related to food consumption has shown an increasing trend since 2010, with the consumption of animal-based products dominating the impacts (around 70%). This increasing trend was common for most of the Member States (20 out of 27) [184]. Indicator: Consumption Footprint (Food) (Source: JRC). 89Fair economic viability in food value chain Income distribution: Ensure fair income and salaries. Improve income of primary producers to ensure their sustainable livelihood. This indicator compares agricultural income to average wages in the economy and provides an estimate of the average income opportunities that a person would have outside of agriculture. It has increased from 31% to 52% between 2005 and 2021 at the EU level, reflecting a CAGR of 3% in this time frame. However, there are discrepancies among Member States. While in certain Member States, such as Hungary and France, farmers' income compared to other wages in the economy has grown more than the EU average, in other Member States like Italy and Belgium, have remained below the EU average or have shown a decreasing trend (e.g. Estonia and Austria). In addition, although the average farm income per worker in the EU has steadily increased over the past decade (by 56% from 2013 to 2021), income levels do not only vary significantly across EU countries, but also across the farming sector and farm size. In particular, farm economic size significantly influences income as higher costs per hectare associated with larger farms are compensated by higher production, leading to greater overall profitability. Indicator: Farmers income compared to wages in the rest of the economy (Source: DG AGRI). Sectorial growth: Help farmers and fishers to strengthen their position in the supply chain and to capture a fair share of the added value of sustainable production. This indicator measures the economic contribution in the agriculture, fishing and aquaculture, as well as the food, beverage, and tobacco sectors. The food, beverage, and tobacco sectors constitute the largest portion of the overall agri-food value chain (over 50%), followed by the agriculture sector. The total value added in the food and agriculture sectors has Increased from 340K in 2008 to 433.5K in 2020 in the EU, with a CAGR of 2%. The compound growth in the manufactured food sector has been higher (2.5%) than the growth in the agriculture sector (1.5%). Indicator: Value added along the food chain (Source: JRC). Market power and business structure: Improve agricultural rules that strengthen the position of farmers (e.g. producers of products with geographical indications), their cooperatives and producer organisations in the food supply chain. This indicator is important to assess the level of investment and development in the agricultural sector. Among Member States, the level of gross fixed capital formation varies. Most Member States surpass the EU average. While countries such as France and Germany have the highest capital formation in agriculture, some Member States lag behind e.g. Czechia, Bulgaria and Estonia. In the EU, gross fixed capital formation in agriculture has increased from EUR 44 Billion in 2005 to EUR 68 Billion in 2022, corresponding to a CAGR of 2.8% and a 55% percentage increase. The growth rates also vary across Member States. As expected, the countries with highest capital formation show limited growth trend e.g. Germany, while the highest growth rates are observed in countries that had lower starting values e.g. Romania, Bulgaria. Indicator: Gross fixed capital formation in agriculture (Source: DG AGRI). Price: Preserve the price affordability of food. The annual average of food prices, indexed to 2015, has increased from 80% (2005) to 125% (2022), an average yearly inflation of almost 2.5%. Since 2015, food prices have risen by 25%, and the biggest increase has taken place in 2022. Indicator: Consumer food inflation (Source: Eurostat). Trade: Foster the competitiveness of the EU supply sector. The EU agri-food trade balance has shown stable growth over the last twenty years, despite a marginal decrease in 2022. It has reached a record level in 2023, with a total surplus of EUR 70.1 billion. While the overall agri-food trade balance shows a surplus, there are variations at the category level. The EU has a trade deficit in several product categories, with the most significant deficits observed in oilseeds and protein crops, and some fruits and nuts. The surplus is spread across product categories, driven mainly by cereal preparations, dairy products, and wine. Indicator: Agricultural and food products trade balance (Source: Eurostat). 90Transport & Infrastructure Transport, accessibility and infrastructure: Create shorter supply chains will support reducing dependence on long-haul transportation. There have been almost no changes in the number of tonnes transported across difference distance categories. Since 2013, approximately 30% of the freight of food products, beverages and tobacco has been transported less than 50 km, and another 30% has been transported between 50 and 150 km. Between 2013 and 2021, the tonnes per kilometre transported for all activities related to the food system (agriculture, fisheries, food manufacturing, trade and services) have increased by 9%, although the tonnes per kilometre transported in the food and beverages manufacturing sector decreased by 5%. Indicator: Annual road freight transport by distance class. (Source: Eurostat). Fair, inclusive and ethical food system Employment and working conditions: Create new job opportunities. Improve working conditions, ensure occupation health and safety. This indicator gives total employment in agriculture, the food industry and food services in absolute terms and also as a share of total employment. The employment in the food sector by economic activity has decreased over the last decade, from 8,474 (in 2013) to 6,326 (in 2022) million persons. During this period the mean annual decrease was 2.88% based on CAGR calculation, therefore around 25% of the employment moved out from the food sector in almost a decade. The share of total employment has also decreased, from 5% (in 2013) to 3% (in 2022). This negative trend indicates a move away from the objective, which aims at creating new job opportunities in the food sector. Indicator: Employment by economic activity (Source: Eurostat). Social protection and poverty: Ensure fair, inclusive and ethical value chains. Ensure workers’ social protection and housing conditions; promote socially responsible production methods; Mitigate the socio- economic consequences impacting the food chain and ensure that the key principles enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights are respected, especially when it comes to precarious, seasonal and undeclared workers. No adequate indicator is available at the moment to assess this objective. Animal welfare: Promote better animal welfare to improve animal health and food quality. No adequate indicator is available at the moment to assess this objective. Food environment Food messaging: Provide food information and labelling to empower consumers to make informed, healthy and sustainable food choices. Strengthen educational messages on the importance of healthy nutrition, sustainable food production and consumption, and reducing food waste. No adequate indicator is available at the moment to assess this objective. Food availability: Improve availability of sustainable food. Ensure that the healthy option is always the easiest one. Ensure food supply. The ratio plant to total protein supply indicator is derived from FAO supply data. The closer the value is to 1, the higher the contribution of plant-based sources to protein supply; the average of the previous three years is taken to reduce error variation. This indicator examines the contribution of plant food sources to total protein (animal and plant) supply and can inform on the transition towards more plant-based food diets based on food supply data. Since 2012, a slight decrease has been observed across most EU countries (between 1 and 5%). The average ratio for the EU region has slightly decreased from 0.42 to 0.40 between 2012 and 2020. This change indicates that a transition towards increased supply of plant-based foods in the EU remains a challenge, possibly linked to a slow progress in the transition towards more plant-based diets in the region. Indicator: Ratio plant to total protein supply (Source: FAO). 91Food awffordability: Ensure affordability to sufficient, nutritious and sustainable food. The percentage of population who cannot afford a healthy diet is reported by FAO and the World Bank for global monitoring. A healthy diet is considered unaffordable when its cost exceeds 52% of income per capita per day. This percentage accounts for a portion of income that can be credibly reserved for food, based on observations that the population in low-income countries spend, on average, 52% of their income on food. The estimated proportion of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet in Europe has dropped 40% from 2.5% in 2017 to 1.5% in 2021. Across EU countries, values ranged between <1% for several countries and 7% in Romania in 2021. The indicator does not account for non-food spending and likely underestimates food affordability issues in the context of the EU region. Indicator: Percent of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet in the EU (Source: FAO). Properties of food: Increase reformulation of food products in line with guidelines for healthy and sustainable diets. No adequate indicator is available at the moment to assess this objective. Nutrition and health Nutrition and healthy, sustainable diets: Move to healthier and more sustainable diets. EU diets are poorly aligned with dietary recommendations, as none of the EU Member States is on track to meet the dietary- related guidelines. In the EU, no country fulfils simultaneously the recommendations for healthy food consumption [185]: the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains nuts and seeds as well as milk and fish is lower than the recommended intake levels (when compared to either national food based dietary guidelines [186] or World Health Organization (WHO) and EAT-Lancet recommendations [187], [188]), while the consumption of red meat is above. However, at the moment there is no adequate indicator available to assess the progress on this objective. The lack of regular, consistent and methodologically harmonised surveys across the EU Member States challenges the coverage and the comparability of such data, being an important gap for the use of these indicators. To overcome the lack of regularity and timeliness of the data, the development of food consumption indicators using data from national dietary surveys to monitor dietary components of healthy diets is being explored. Health impact of diets: Reversing of the rise in overweight and obesity rates across the EU by 2030. The indicator as reported in Eurostat indicates that the proportion of overweight adults in the EU has slightly increased from 51% in 2014 to 53% in 2019. Reversing the prevalence of overweight in the EU remains a public health challenge considering the negative trends observed. Indicator: Obesity rate by body mass index (Source: Eurostat). Food security: Ensuring food security and access to quality, safe, sustainable, nutritious food for all. In 2022, the FAO estimated that 7.8% of the population in Europe experienced moderate or severe food insecurity. Among EU countries, values for 2022 ranged between 2% in Italy and 19% in Romania. Analysis of the trends indicate prevalence of food insecurity has slightly improved until 2019 but reversed in the last years. Indicator: Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the EU population (Source: FAO). Resilience Preparedness, shock resilience, adaptation and transformation: Strengthen the resilience of the EU food system. Build up resilience to climate change, possible future diseases and pandemics. Increasing the sustainability of food producers will ultimately increase their resilience. In the absence of agreed categories and calculation methodology, currently, the resilience of food system cannot be described with a single indicator. 92Implementation challenges Note: This section is grounded on the Report from the Commission (COM(2023)707) on the summary of CAP Strategic Plans (CSPs) for 2023-2027 [8]. In addition, the EIR 2022, the Climate Action Progress report and the draft assessment of NECPs were consulted, as well as the ESABCC report on climate neutrality [6], [10], [15]. This section will be expanded providing a focus on selected enablers to possibly over- come challenges and support a more sustainable food system in the EU in the follow-up of this report. As far as the primary production is concerned, the Environmental and Climate Goals Report from the Commission on the summary of Important challenges remain in terms of the status CAP Strategic Plans (CSPs) for 2023-2027 provides of biodiversity, especially on intensively farmed land. first qualitative indications on the Plans’ combined The report by the European Scientific Advisory Board efforts towards the CAP’s objectives [8]. The CSPs on Climate Change [10] asks for more support and are the single planning tool for Member States with ambitious measures and incentives to meet the a view to move towards a performance-based CAP emission and pollution reduction targets. In addition, implementation. By addressing their specific needs the State of the Energy Union Report 2023 (COM(2023) the CSPs are expected to be consistent with and 650) [72] and Climate Action Progress Report 2023 contribute to the Union’s environmental and climate [15] highlight that progress in emission reduction has legislation and commitments, contributing to meet the been recently far too slow in agriculture, i.e. stable at 2030 targets outlined in the Farm to Fork Strategy and the same level as ten years ago.

In turn, this to date, agricultural income remains significantly lower is also due to the lack of GHG emission-pricing regimes than the average wage in the rest of the economy of in the agricultural sector. all Member States. CAP support plays a significant role in many sectors and MS although unevenly distributed. Socio-economic disparities Many Member States continue to face challenges There are socio-economic challenges within the with sluggish (and sometimes stagnant) growth in agricultural sector and rural areas, such as ageing agricultural productivity, further strained by high costs, workforce and a decline share of rural employment, particularly in labour and land. The CSPs emphasise access to capital, basic services and infrastructures enhancing productivity and encouraging the adoption especially in remote areas. These challenges are of innovative practices and technologies to address considered to undermine the long-term sustainability these issues. and attractiveness of farming as a career, in turn undermining EU food security, and the resilience of EU rural areas. 93Technological and Innovative Practices opportunities, including both technological and Adoption of innovative practices and technologies behavioural options [189]. However, many challenges is still slow, which hampers productivity growth and persist and the outcome of the CSPs will also depend on environmental sustainability. Investment in such areas many external factors, as well as farming community’s is critical but the planned financial allocation does not level of engagement, according to the Commission appear to match the broad range of needs. report. Besides, the ESABCC registered both a policy and ambition gaps with respect to the initial schedule Resource Efficiency under the EGD and the Farm to Fork initiative, with no Issues like water scarcity, nutrient management, and legislative framework proposed for sustainable food the reduction of chemical inputs are prominent.

The first step was the launch of a some plans aim to address these through improved strategic dialogue on the future of the EU agriculture management practices and investments, greater between key EU food system stakeholders in January collective effort is required to meet the environmental 2024. The dialogue aims at developing a joint targets set by the EU. This is confirmed by the understanding and a common vision around four major Environmental Implementation Review 2022, which questions raised by President von der Leyen at the reports that over 70% of Member States are at a high launching event, namely regarding how to ensure a fair risk of not meeting their ammonia emission reduction standard of living to farmers and rural communities, the targets for 2020-2029 and beyond 2030. To comply support to agriculture within the planetary boundaries, with these targets, it is crucial to adopt low-emission and the role of knowledge and technological innovation agricultural practices, particularly in livestock, manure, in agriculture while staying competitive, and the role of and fertiliser management.

Finally, the transition groundwater and eutrophication. towards more sustainable food systems is challenged by personal choices, which could also be driven by low Sustainable Food System income households and food affordability. The Farm The Farm to Fork, the Common Agricultural Policy and to Fork strategy acknowledges that shifting towards the Common Fisheries Policy are the foundations, healthier and plant-based diets is key to change together with the EU Biodiversity strategy and the EU consumption patterns, curb food waste, and eventually forest strategy, for a transformative change towards contributing to GHG emission reduction. Consumer a sustainable food system, fisheries and forest behaviours, often influenced by a lack of transparency management in the EU as envisaged by the EGD. and difficulty in accessing sustainable food options, The transition to a more sustainable food system further complicate efforts towards a more sustainable should include identifying cross-sectoral mitigation food system. 94Key messages The EU food system provides food to over more than 450 million people in the EU and many more around the world, contributing to the EU’s economic development and employment. While it is a competitive and diversified sector, the EU food system faces challenges regarding the environment, health, society and economy. A system approach is needed to tackle these challenges, encompassing all sustainability dimensions and involved actors. To achieve the overall 55% net GHG reduction target in the EU by 2030, further efforts are also needed in the food system. Progress is ongoing but is hindered by data gaps and the unpredictability of certain components of the GHG food system emissions indicator. Meeting reduction targets for more hazardous pesticides and nutrient losses remains challenging and requires acceleration. Available data indicate that further efforts are necessary in particular to expand the area of organic farming, reduce fishing pressure, and address issues related to food waste reduction. While overall productivity in the agrifood sector has grown, also energy consumption in agriculture, forestry, and the food industry has increased, necessitating improved energy efficiency. The consumption footprint of food showed an increasing trend, primarily driven by animal-based products (despite recent decreasing trends of pro-capita consumption for bovine and pig meat). The EU food system contributed to the transgression of some planetary boundaries. The agrifood sector, mainly primary production, shows a structural reduction in employment, indicating that there is still work to be done in creating new job opportunities and reducing socio-economic disparities. Next Generation Access broadband availability in rural areas has significantly improved; however, acceleration is needed to achieve the objective of 100% coverage by 2025. The EU faces public health challenges from unhealthy diets, including high rates of overweight, obesity, and non-communicable diseases, which pose significant health and economic burdens. Addressing these issues alongside the transition to more sustainable diets requires creating food environments that offer more affordable healthy and sustainable food choices, particularly for low-income groups, to improve health and ensure food security. The CAP Strategic Plans are designed to implement the CAP objectives while contributing to the EU's climate ambitions and the Farm to Fork and Biodiversity goals. Achieving these goals will require addressing socio-economic disparities, ensuring wider technological innovation uptake and full consistency with quantitative EU GHG reduction targets, fostering climate resilience, and behavioural change. A concerted effort is needed to enable low-emissions agriculture, combining policy ambition, community engagement, and support for vulnerable actors. 95A honeybee sips nectar from a lavender flower Photo by David Clode on Unsplash 06 Preserving and protecting biodiversityPreserving and protecting biodiversityPreserving and protecting biodiversity Factsheet Enabling transformative change is one of the main purposes of the EU Biodiversity Strategy and the consequent Nature Restoration Law and New EU Forest Strategy. Together and in tandem with other initiatives (e.g. the Farm to Fork and Chemical Strategy), they aim to ensure that biodiversity is considered in the economy and society, addressing the direct as well as indirect drivers of biodiversity loss. In particular, the EU puts the concept of healthy soils at the core of the European Green Deal, with the Soil Monitoring Law and the EU Soil Strategy for 2030 issued in 2021 and 2023 respectively.

PRESERVING AND PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY Policy context The Convention on Biological Diversity (a tool The assessments of habitats and ecosystems of Agenda 21) comprehends the action plan for [194], [195] show that most habitats protected biodiversity conservation at the global, national under the Habitats Directives are in an and local level by organisations of the United unfavourable conservation status. The analysis Nations System. It defines biodiversity as more than of trends of pressures highlights a mixed picture, living beings and their ecosystems, including people, but overall, the current potential of ecosystems to their need for food security, medicines, fresh air and deliver services is equal to or lower than the baseline water, shelter, and a clean and healthy environment value in 2010. This decrease suggests ecosystem in which to live. This definition is used throughout this degradation in many jurisdictions. In line with the chapter, focusing on three key aspects of biodiversity IPBES, enabling transformative change is one of the mentioned in the European Green Deal: nature main lines of action of the Nature Restoration Law protection and restoration, soil quality and biodiversity (NRL), the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 (BDS) and in the economy and society. To do so, the concept of the New EU Forest Strategy for 2030, which aims to sustainable use is defined in Article 2 of the Convention ensure that biodiversity is considered in the economy on Biological Diversity as the use of components of and society, addressing the direct as well as indirect biodiversity in a way and at a rate that allows the drivers of biodiversity loss. In particular, the EU puts the long-term maintenance or improvement of biodiversity concept of healthy soils at the core of the European for the generations to come. This approach agrees Green Deal, with the Soil Monitoring Law and the with the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform EU Soil Strategy for 2030, issued in 2021 and 2023 on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) respectively. The mentioned documents aim to ensure Assessment Report on Sustainable Use of Wild Species that all soils in Member States can provide as many [190], which speaks about the social-ecological systems essential ecosystem services as possible and will be and the sustainable use that allows their functioning substantiated by measurable indicators based on while contributing to human well-being [191]. reliable data. Moreover, the concept of transformative According to the EUSO Soil Health Dashboard change from the UN Agenda 2030 designates [196], [197], 61% of EU soils are affected by one “a fundamental, system-wide reorganisation or more soil degradation processes and, therefore, across technological, economic and social factors, can be considered unhealthy. The current value is including paradigms, goals and values”, necessary in line with the headline assessment made for the to achieve the SDGs. Change is needed, since establishment of a Mission Soil that 60-70% of the biodiversity and ecosystem services are on a trajectory soils of Europe were in an unhealthy state. Soil erosion of decline [190]: “goals for 2030 and beyond may only is the major land degradation process which may threat be achieved through transformative changes across land productivity, ecosystem services and food security. economic, social, political and technological factors”.

However, this target is a comprehensive way. Finally, in November 2023 not included into the EU Green Deal legislation. the Council and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the Nature Restoration Law, which is included in the same table as legally binding targets in this report for the sake of better organisation of information, and the Council vote finally approved the law in mid-2024. The amendment to the regulation on Environmental Economic accounts, introducing, ecosystem accounts, also plays a central role, since ecosystem accounting is needed to estimate the dependencies and impacts of economic activities on the biodiversity. Specific laws and actions such as Marine Action Plan [200] are in place to regulate maritime activities, in particular fisheries and aquacultures, and protect and restore marine areas, since the seas offer important ecosystem services to a large part of the EU population, but they are particularly hard to account for. The rich package of EU laws introduced and proposed aims to mitigate or solve the problems highlighted in the evaluation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2020 [201]. 101Assessment of progress Note 1. Many targets from the Nature Restoration Law appear towards the targets to lack the indicators or data necessary to quantify the state of progress towards the target. The NRL allows, in principle, Member States to use data sets alternative to the EU-level ones. These data sets will have to be scrutinised in the National Restoration Plans drafting process, and if deemed appropriate, Member States This section provides an overview of the assessment for will be allowed to use them.

The complete achievement of the 'Nature Restoration Law' target also depends on the restoration methods used and the specific marine ecosystems to be restored. The recovery period length varies with the marine habitats targeted for restoration. In addition, Member States face several other challenges in implementing these strategies [205]. The actual implementation of the Biodiversity Strategy target on effective marine protected areas (30% overall and 10% strictly protected by 2030), through passive restoration methods, as well as the other directives such as the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and the 2023 Marine Action Plan would contribute to achieving this target.

Legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU’s land The 26% of EU’s land area is covered by protected areas, including 18.6% by area and of 30% of the EU’s sea area Natura 2000 designated protected areas and 17.3% by nationally designated Biodiversity Strategy protected areas. If the designation of protected areas continues at the rate seen in the past decade (1.7 percentage points increase since 2011), the target will not be met [209]. 12% of EU's sea area is currently covered by protected areas, including 9% by Natura 2000 designated protected areas and 4.5% by nationally designated protected areas. 2.a Strictly protect at least a third of the EU’s Indicators are missing to check whether the EU is on track or not. Seven out of protected areas the nine actions set in the EU BDS to foster biodiversity protection in the EU still Biodiversity Strategy need to be implemented by 2030, but they all appear on track so far.

The use Biodiversity Strategy and risk of chemical pesticides shows a decrease of 6% from 2020, and an overall Target in common with the Farm to Fork Strategy and decrease in the first four years of observation of 33% from the baseline period of already assessed in Thematic Area 5 2015-2017. These overall downward trends shows that the first part of the target can be achieved by 2030 [182]. On the other side, according to data published by DG SANTE, the use of more hazardous pesticides fell by 21% between the baseline period of 2015–2017 and 2021. The use of more hazardous pesticides shows an increase of 5% from 2020 to 2021. Achievement of the 50% reduction target by 2030 remains challenging. It should be noted, while this indicator intends to monitor the use of the more hazardous pesticides, it does not take into account the exposure and hence the impact they might have on the environment and human health. In the future, this indicator should be complemented with a risk indicator showing changes in the actual risks. 1 It should be noted that the current EU-wide indicator, which applies risk weightings to four differ- ent groups of chemical pesticides and is based on pesticide sales, is not considered scientifically robust by some. This indicator is based on a similar harmonised risk indicator, which, according to the European legislation (Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782), is considered hazard-based. This is due to the absence of statistics on the use of plant protection products needed to develop a risk indicator. The Commission is committed to developing more sophisticated indicators in future, such as improved weightings that take hazard properties into account in a more granular way or by using EU-level data on pesticide usage when it becomes available. An example of such an improvement is the new risk indicator assessing the toxicity of pesticide residues in soil from samples collected under the LUCAS Soil Pesticide survey coordinated by JRC. According to this indicator, in 2018, 14% of sites in the EU were at risk of negative effects on soil organisms due to pesticide residues. The analysis of samples from 2022 is currently ongoing and will shed light on the EU’s progress towards pesticide risk reductions. This indicator is relevant to only one compartment (soil) but is just one of many being examined for usefulness and relevance. . 13.

This section is based on critical reviews of the Environmental Implementation Review 2022, Communication on the ‘EU wide assessment of the draft updated National Energy and Climate Plans (COM(2023) 796) [7], and sectorial reporting. Biodiversity-related initiatives are cross-cutting (they might contribute to initiatives in Thematic Areas 1, 4, 5 and 7), and additional insights may be referenced in other chapters. This section will be expanded to focus on selected enablers aimed at overcoming challenges and enhancing the achievement of the biodiversity preservation and protection targets, in the follow-up of this report. The Biodiversity Strategy has been designed to Public awareness and the funding for mitigating work in tandem with many other initiatives (e.g. the harmful consequences of biodiversity the Farm to Fork, with which it shares some targets; deterioration are still lagging behind those the new EU Forest Strategy to support sustainable related to climate change.

The implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy is driving transformative change and reinforcing the EU's role in global conservation efforts. The adopted Nature Restoration Law is a key legal instrument to fulfil the objectives of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, focusing on species and ecosystem restoration. Not only will it make a positive impact on species and ecosystems restoration, but it will also promote data collection for better monitoring and policy implementation. Biodiversity targets have a broad scope in the EGD, requiring multiple indicators to assess progress. While some data is available, more is needed for a comprehensive evaluation. Meanwhile, ecosystem restoration and protection remain crucial for progress toward EGD targets. The EU Biodiversity and Soil strategies aim to reduce soil contamination, land take and erosion, particularly in agricultural areas. Despite improvements, EU soil data reveals issues, such as expanding contamination and shrinking carbon sinks. The EU Forest strategy is expected to accelerate the protection and restoration of EU forests, with the remaining 3% of primary and old-growth forests to be strictly protected by 2029. Biodiversity preservation supports human well-being and is strongly connected to food systems and zero-pollution efforts. Protecting biodiversity also helps mitigate risks like new diseases, food shortages, floods, and droughts. Despite progress, biodiversity still continues to decline due to human activities. Funding is insufficient for mitigating the effects, and data gaps persist. EU policy instruments have not been fully adopted by Member States. Biodiversity is linked to ecosystem management, especially in the agriculture and forestry sectors. Forest management, which impacts 80% of EU forests, is crucial for forest ecosystem and biodiversity conditions. Agricultural intensification contributes to biodiversity and ecosystem degradation (in particular, the decline of pollinators and soil erosion), while healthy ecosystems are essential for food security. The decline of pollinators can have a huge economic and productivity impact on agriculture. 109Caspian Sea © NASA on Unsplash 07 Towards a zero pollution ambition for a toxic free environmentTowards a zero pollution ambition for a toxic free environmentTowards a zero pollution ambition for a toxic free environment Factsheet The zero pollution vision for 2050 is for air, water and soil pollution to be reduced to levels no longer considered harmful to health and natural ecosystems, that respect the boundaries with which our planet can cope.

The new parameters include per- and polyfluorinated Directive 2020/2184 (‘Drinking Water Directive) compounds and bisphenol A, setting limit values for their presence in drinking water. As of the end of 2022, EU level data on drinking water quality were still limited, with the latest data available dating from 2011 and 2013. The new directive also foresees a watch list mechanism for emerging pollutants. The Directive’s Impact Assessment includes the calculation of the “SAPEA” Popu- lation Potentially at Health Risk indicator, estimating the share of the population that could potentially suffer from health problems because of the presence of contaminants in drinking water. According to the indicator, in 2015, 22.7 million people were potentially at health risk due to non-safe drinking water, equivalent to 4 % of the EU population. The revised Directive is expected to positively impact drinking water quality. However, estimated data for 2015 is not sufficient to assess the status of drinking water quality with respect to its evolution over time and new additional parameters by the revised directive, as confirmed by the EEA. Member States have started complying with the reporting requirements in 2023.

Directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe Air Quality The revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive Access to sanitation. There is a positive trend in the access to basic sanitation and (UWWTD) extends the scope of the 1991 UWWTD to connection to secondary wastewater treatment. Overall, the share of population improve and maintain access to sanitation for all, in without a bath, shower, or indoor flushing toilet in their household decreased from particular for vulnerable and marginalised groups, 2.2% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2020 [234].

In many cases, nitrogen and phosphorus are well removed from wastewater, but there are still regions where additional removal could bring a significant benefit to the environment. In many cases, the costs of additional removal are well below the benefits that could be achieved, and some wastewater treatment plants operate already beyond the requirements of Directive 91/271/ EEC. The revision of the Directive aims to push nutrient removal further by imposing stricter standards. This would also contribute indirectly to the reduction of GHG emissions. Quaternary treatment. While secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment is being implemented compliant with Directive 91/271/EEC, several chemical micropollutants escape treatment plants and contribute to pollution of the receiving waters (e.g. pharmaceuticals and ingredients in personal care products). The revision of the Directive aims to require quaternary treatment for all larger plants, also based on an extended producer responsibility scheme that would help finance the corresponding treatment costs. Water Quality NON-BINDING TARGETS (FROM PROPOSALS) Targets Assessment By means of an updated and harmonised list of Micro-pollutants pose a significant challenge. The necessity of removing them pollutants affecting surface and groundwater, at wastewater treatment facilities increases treatment costs, and complete updated existing quality standards, new monitoring removal is not always feasible.

However, there is no harmonised methodology for their identification and quantification, and one should still be developed. The current database on soil pollution with plastics is still poor and no good prediction could be done. The EU has taken measures to combat microplastic pollution on all fronts (e.g. ban of certain single-use plastic products, restriction of intentionally produced microplastics and reduction of plastic pellet loss), aiming at reducing microplastic releases to the environment by 30% by 2030.

Soil erosion has decreased by around 10% in the period 2000-2016, but future trends are alarming due to climate change. Soil loss by water erosion is projected to increase by 13–22.5 % in EU and UK by 2050. Soil 119Implementation challenges Note: This section highlights major challenges to implementing the Zero Pollution Action Plan targets (and related environmental policies). This section grounds on critical reviews of the Environmental Implementation Review 2022. Pollution-related initiatives are cross-cutting, and they might contribute to biodiversity-related initiatives (further insights might be found in the thematic area 6 chapter). This section will be expanded providing a focus on selected enablers to possibly overcome challenges and boost the achievement of the ZPAP targets in the follow-up of this report. The path to making the EGD Zero Pollution decision-making, and lead to better environmental ambitions a reality is challenging, as highlighted outcomes. by the Environmental Implementation Review 2022.

Integrating environmental considerations Many challenges might be hindering the amelioration into all stages of public investment, from planning of EU water bodies: incomplete or incorrect assessment through implementation, requires specific expertise that of pressures and impacts of activities on water bodies, may not be readily available in all localities [35].

Progress has been achieved in reducing air pollution, leading to a significant decrease in air pollution-related deaths. Moreover, the EU is on track to cut the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50%, as well as a reduction in antimicrobial sales for farmed animals and aquaculture by 2021. The implementation of the recently agreed Ambient Air Quality Directives is expected to reduce the area of EU ecosystems under threat from air pollution by 25% in 2030 compared to 2005. Progress is slower in other areas, such as noise, which is not expected to decline by more than 19% by 2030. Similarly, concerning water quality, the input of nutrients into water, the chemical load and the concentration of plastic litter at sea are reducing at a low pace and acceleration is needed in order to reach the target of a 50% reduction by 2030. Aligning longstanding water policies with the Zero Pollution and EGD ambitions required a number of updates to legislative frameworks. These updates will result in revised lists of pollutants that Member States will be required to monitor and report on in coming years. They are also expected to enhance data quality, thereby facilitating the monitoring of the Zero Pollution Action Plan. Additional efforts will be needed to reach the EU's ambitions of significantly reducing waste generation and ensuring that all soils are in a healthy condition. Waste generation experienced a reduction as a result of the pandemic-related economic slowdown. The future trends for soils are alarming, with climate change exacerbating erosion. Emerging pollution concerns, such as microplastics in the environment, still lack data for a thorough assessment of expected progress by 2030.

Around 30% of the policy initiatives proposed by the European Commission between 2020 and 2024 directly concern the implementation of the EGD. This includes new initiatives such as the ground-breaking European Climate Law, as well as ambitious revisions and updates of previous directives and regulations, such as the Renewable Energy Directive. Achieving these ambitions requires increased scientific and technical support to policies, including an integrated assessment of progress towards targets, now and in the future, as well as the early identification of potential knowledge gaps. Complying with the ambitions of the EGD requires a sustained, collective effort, since it entails a societal, economic, and governmental shift towards alternative and more sustainable ways of producing, consuming and behaving. Despite these structural challenges and the relatively recent implementation of some policies, progress is under way in many areas. As the Commission’s in-house research service, the JRC has explored in this report how the Green Deal ambitions can be achieved, based on robust scientific expertise across all of the EGD’s domains (climate, energy, circular economy, mobility, food system, biodiversity and pollution). This is the first integrated benchmark offering a comprehensive update on progress made towards the EGD goals and targets. Internal data was combined with external, publicly available data, resulting in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. This report helps to identify the areas which require additional and more urgent efforts, highlighting the need for increased attention from Member States to implement the EGD policies effectively and foster the transformation to sustainability. Notably, the analysis is limited to providing a snapshot of the current status of target implementation based on available knowledge and data, without aiming to evaluate the policies themselves. The effects of the policies that have recently come into force to boost acceleration towards targets achievement will only become evident in the coming years. This report has identified 154 quantifiable policy targets, either legally binding (from directives and regulations) or non-legally binding from communications and legislative proposals (most of which have already been agreed upon). The results of the assessment indicate progress for 96 targets (62%). However, only 32 targets are fully on track (21%), while acceleration is needed for 64 targets (41%). Additionally, 15 targets (10%) are not progressing – they are either moving in the opposite direction or stagnating. Data are not available or insufficient for the remaining 43 targets (28%). Legally binding targets account for 56% of all those identified (87 out of 154). Almost half of these (42 targets) show a positive trend, although only 13 are currently on track, with the majority requiring accelerated progress. Conversely, 12 legally binding targets are off-track or stagnating, while data are not yet available for the remaining 33 targets. The timing of the binding policies, most of which have been recently agreed and are expected to deliver results in the coming years, is a significant factor influencing these assessments. The effective implementation of the Fit for 55 package will contribute to the 2030 climate ambitions. 124Addressing the high number of implementation challenges that have emerged demands dedicated efforts at all levels, alongside parallel actions with other institutions (see the box below). Climate change mitigation efforts must be intensified as current reductions in sectors covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation and the LULUCF regulation are falling short. Accelerated action is especially critical in agriculture and carbon removal strategies. Methane emissions also require intensified abatement efforts. Despite a 32.5% decrease in EU GHG net emissions from 1990 to 2022, the pace of reduction from 2020 to 2030 must accelerate significantly compared to previous decades. THEMATIC FOCUS What other research shows about the EU Green Transition A comprehensive, cross-cutting, and interdisciplinary approach is crucial to effectively assess the EGD ambitions and verify our alignment with set targets. Two recent reports are particularly noteworthy for their consensus on the assessment of EGD’s progress: the 2023 “Monitoring report on progress towards the 8th EAP objectives” by the European Environment Agency (EEA) [2], and the 2024 report from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), “Towards EU climate neutrality: progress, policy gaps, and opportunities” [10]. These reports highlight a scientific consensus on the actual state of play regarding the implementation of targets, and collectively confirm the achievement of crucial objectives, while also indicating that there is still distance to cover towards the EGD policy goals. The report from EEA presents 28 indicators across different sectors, including several socio-economics indicators. In addition, the report from ESABCC focuses on GHG emissions, considering about 50 indicators in different areas. Overall, both reports include indicators in common with the JRC report, and their assessment is well aligned with the one presented in this work (see details in Annex). While acknowledging policy gaps and implementation challenges, a shared perspective emerges on the necessity of consistent and coherent policy responses to achieve our ambitious goals. This consensus is a positive indicator of the overall EGD’s direction and serves as a foundation for further strategic discussions and analyses. 125laeDneergUE# The transition to clean energy should also be accelerated, with a focus on increasing the share of renewable energy sources. This requires substantial investments in renewable energy infrastructure, scaling up renewable hydrogen production, and strengthening power grids. To support this shift, it is crucial to accelerate the adoption of renewable hydrogen in industry and transport, along with developing dedicated infrastructure and an efficient hydrogen market. Additionally, current trends in energy consumption and energy efficiency must be reversed. Conversely, the EU is progressing to meet its ambitions in circular economy, where about 30% of set targets are on track. However, trends must be reversed in the circular material use rate, and urgent acceleration is needed in recycling and preparation for reuse of waste, as most Member States are at risk of missing these 2025 targets. Initiatives must therefore prioritise waste reduction and material recovery, while addressing challenges related to data availability and the adoption of circular practices. In sustainable mobility, decarbonisation of road transport requires a robust infrastructure for alternative fuels, with significant acceleration in deploying renewable hydrogen and electric charging stations. Advanced biofuels, biogas and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) will be vital for decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation and maritime transport. While urban transport is moving towards electrification, more rapid reductions in CO emissions from heavy-duty vehicles are still 2 needed. In the food system, trends need to be reversed in dietary patterns and health outcomes, employment quality, food affordability, consumption footprint, energy consumption, and waste generation. It is also essential to address challenges such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and reducing food waste. The biodiversity thematic area presents particular challenges: 45% of the targets cannot currently be evaluated due to the lack of defined parameters and indicators for comprehensive biodiversity monitoring. In general, biodiversity and ecosystem restoration efforts should be accelerated, accompanied by improved data collection and monitoring to better assess progress towards targets. Progress has been made towards zero pollution in the areas of air pollution, chemical pesticides, and antimicrobial sales However, challenges remain in the areas of noise pollution, water quality, waste generation and emerging concerns such as microplastics. Next steps This preliminary assessment of progress on EGD targets serves as a gauge of the complexity of the systemic transformation necessary for the success of the green transition in general, and the EGD in particular. This work is an important piece of the puzzle in understanding where the EU stands, identifying what is needed to bridge the remaining gaps and accelerate progress, and anticipating the challenges ahead. This “distance to target” analysis is just the first step. The follow-up will provide an integrated perspective of the EGD policy targets, diving deeper into the barriers to implementation and into potential enablers, to gain a better understanding of the state of the green transition in the EU. Furthermore, targets associated with EGD policies vary widely and are often interlinked across different policies. Their synergies and trade-offs must be viewed holistically. In future work, an integrated environmental assessment will address the evolution of production and consumption patterns, estimating 126laeDneergUE# the overall life cycle related impacts. This will enable the assessment of key environmental interlinkages as well as the consideration of the role of supply chains in either helping to reach the targets or hampering their achievement. As growing consumption is a key megatrend, the accounting of direct emissions from EU production will be accompanied by an estimation of those produced indirectly through consumption. This will be crucial to consider the externalisation of impacts through international trade and global value chains. The work carried out so far will stimulate a speedy assessment of ways to boost the achievement of the EGD ambitions in this decade. Future work will present examples of effective solutions and cross-cutting conditions, such as the role of digital technologies, research and innovation, education, training and skills, green finance, just transition and multi-level governance. The findings of this work will provide valuable insights towards developing effective strategies in the future: it is only through science and policy collaboration, innovation, and evidence-based policy that the transformative changes required for a sustainable future can be identified and achieved. Fostering the sustainability transformation and achieving the ambitions of the European Green Deal requires closer cooperation between scientists and policymakers. Only when policies are based on robust scientific evidence, can they make a significant contribution to the Green Deal’s environmental, social and economic objectives, thereby making a success of the green transition. 127128References [1] HANCHER Leigh, MEEUS Leonardo, NOUICER Athir, REIF Valerie, and European University Institute, The EU Green Deal (2022 ed.), LU: Florence School of Regulation, 2022. https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2870/00714 [2] European Environment Agency, ‘European Union 8th Environment Action Programme: monitoring report on progress towards the 8th EAP objectives: 2023 edition’, Publications Office, LU, 2023. https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2800/34224 [3] K.
