## Diversify the Union’s imports of strategic raw materials with a view to ensuring that, by 2030, the Union’s annual consumption of each strategic raw ma- terial at any relevant stage of processing can rely on imports from several third countries or from overseas countries or territories (OCTs) and that no third country accounts for more than 65% of the Union’s annual consumption of such a strategic raw material. Regulation (EU) 2024/1252

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: Half of the 16 strategic raw materials have values above the 65% target, therefore there is a low diversification of sourcing countries. These include bismuth, gallium, lithium, magnesium, platinum group metals, and both heavy and light rare earth elements.
