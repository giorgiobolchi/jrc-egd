## Producers of LMT batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall attain, and maintain durably, at least the following collection targets of waste LMT batteries:
- 51% by 31 December 2028; - 61% by 31 December 2031. Regulation (EU) 2023/1542

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: The calculation methodology is under development and these targets will be updated accordingly, whilst maintaining the same level of ambition. Considering that light means of transport batteries represent a new market and collection systems need to be adapted, currently it is not possible to assess whether these ambitious targets are reachable or not.
