## Halve the amount of residual (non-recycled) municipal waste by 2030
A new Circular Economy Action Plan

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: For this target, 2020 was assumed as the reference year, since the new CEAP was published in March 2020. This target is also recalled in the 'Zero Pollution Action Plan'. The target aims at halving the amount of residual municipal waste by 2030. Assuming as a reference year the 2020, the residual municipal waste should be reduced from 119 to 59.5 Mtonnes.
Looking at historical trends, the amount of residual municipal waste decreased by only 5% in the time frame 2012-2021 and slightly increased in the last seven years (2015-2021, +2.6%). Despite increasing recycling levels, the amount of waste generated is increasing at a higher pace [130].
