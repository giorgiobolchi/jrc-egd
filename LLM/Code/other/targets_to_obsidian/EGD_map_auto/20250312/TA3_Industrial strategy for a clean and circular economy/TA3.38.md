## Each vehicle belonging to a vehicle type that is type-approved as of [the first day of the month following 72 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation] under Regulation (EU) 2018/858 shall be constructed so that it is:
(a) reusable/recyclable to a minimum of 85% by mass; (b) reusable/recoverable to a minimum of 95 % by mass. Proposal for a Regulation on circularity requirements for vehicle design and on management of end-of-life vehicles

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: The feasibility of the target depends on the calculation method and related data. As stated in the impact assessment study, while substantial progress has been made since 2000 to reach the 85% recycling/reuse target set out in the ELV Directive, a large share of materials, in particular automotive shredder residue, is sent to landfills or incinerated (i.e. not valorised) [128].
