Assessment: The historical time trends (2011-2022) for the EU self-sufficiency at processing phase for the 16 strategic materials can be extracted based on data from [121] and [122] and [123]. Results show that:
- The EU’s self-sufficiency for copper, cobalt and germanium was above the benchmark in 2022. For copper, this value has been stably above 80% in the period 2011-2022. For cobalt and germanium, the trend was fluctuating and more unstable, but increasing in between 2018 and 2022.
- The EU’s self-sufficiency was below the benchmark in 2022 for bismuth, boron, gallium and platinum group metals, with gallium showing a drastic decrease from 2011 (100%) to 2022 (2%).
- The EU has no self-sufficiency to process lithium, magnesium, natural graphite, titanium, and both heavy and light rare earth elements, while there is no sufficient data available for tungsten, nickel and manganese.
