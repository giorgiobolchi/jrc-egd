## ETS2. Contribution of the buildings and road transport sectors of 43% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a combined cost-efficient contribution of 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005
Directive (EU) 2023/959

Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: The ETS2 is a new EU-wide cap-and-trade economic instrument that covers the CO2 emissions from the combustion of fuels in road transport, buildings, and other sectors (mainly smaller industries), excluding agriculture. Monitoring starts in 2025, with cap and trade applying from 2027. As such, it overlaps significantly with the ESR in terms of sectors covered, but important differences are that a) it is implemented at the EU level, rather than through Member State-specific policies, and b) it does not cover non-CO2 emissions, many of which are from the hard-to- tackle agricultural sector.
Between 2005 and 2022, the emissions covered by the ETS 2 fell by 16% according to own estimates of the JRC. However, since the ETS2 instrument is newly implemented and official reporting by Member States is not yet available, the progress cannot currently be evaluated.
