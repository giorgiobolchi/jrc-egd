## Reduce methane emissions by 35 to 37% compared to 2005 levels, by 2030
An EU Strategy to reduce methane emissions

Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: Methane emissions were 497.15 MtCO2e in 2005 and decreased to 394.37 MtCO2e in 2022, making a reduction of about 20.67%. However, acceleration is needed to reach at least a 35% reduction by 2030.
The largest source of methane emissions in the EU is the agriculture sector, accounting for more than half of the total emissions, followed by the energy and waste sectors. Within agriculture, almost all methane emissions are from livestock: 80% of the total stems from enteric fermentation and 18% from manure man- agement. Furthermore, the energy sector showed the highest decline in emissions, primarily due to the mitigation of fugitive emissions from fuels, including emis- sions from the extraction of solid fuels and those associated with oil and natural gas production and distribution.
Most methane emissions from the waste sector come from solid waste disposal.
