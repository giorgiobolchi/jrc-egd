Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: There is a considerable potential for reducing fossil fuel-based energy use and GHG emissions in wastewater treatment and market incentives are increasingly attractive for investments in this direction. Member states should be required to ensure that the total annual energy used by all urban wastewater treatment plants on their territory treating a load of 10 000 population equivalent1 and above does not exceed the production of energy from renewable sources.
