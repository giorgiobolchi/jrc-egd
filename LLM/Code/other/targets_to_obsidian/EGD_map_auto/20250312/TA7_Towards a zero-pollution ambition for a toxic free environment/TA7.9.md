## The revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) extends the scope of the 1991 UWWTD to improve and maintain access to sanitation for all, in particular for vulnerable and marginalised groups, while aligning with the ZPAP and EGD climate and energy objectives.
This will be ensured by a number of new obligations on secondary treatment, now extended to all agglomerations with at least 1 000 population equivalent , by 2035. Member States will ensure the application of:
- Tertiary treatment, for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus (by 2039)
- Quaternary treatment, for the removal of a broad spectrum of micropollutants (by 2045)
These apply to larger plants of 150 000 p.e. (and above, with intermediate targets).

Assessment: Access to sanitation. There is a positive trend in the access to basic sanitation and connection to secondary wastewater treatment. Overall, the share of population without a bath, shower, or indoor flushing toilet in their household decreased from 2.2% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2020 [234]. However, in some Member States, there were still high shares of the population without access to basic sanitary facilities in 2020. The share of the EU population connected to secondary wastewater treatment has also increased continuously since 2000, reaching 81.1% in
2020 [234]. The revision of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive aims to bring additional improvements not only for water quality, but also for access to sanitation [235].
Secondary treatment. Small agglomerations constitute a significant pressure
on 11% of the EUâ€™s surface water bodies [236]. Currently, the situation varies across the EU, with some Member States requesting all urban wastewater to be treated and others having set standards for small agglomerations beyond the requirements set in Directive 91/271/EEC [237].
Tertiary treatment. In many cases, nitrogen and phosphorus are well removed from wastewater, but there are still regions where additional removal could bring a significant benefit to the environment. In many cases, the costs of additional removal are well below the benefits that could be achieved, and some wastewater treatment plants operate already beyond the requirements of Directive 91/271/ EEC. The revision of the Directive aims to push nutrient removal further by imposing stricter standards. This would also contribute indirectly to the reduction of GHG emissions.
Quaternary treatment. While secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment
is being implemented compliant with Directive 91/271/EEC, several chemical micropollutants escape treatment plants and contribute to pollution of the receiving waters (e.g. pharmaceuticals and ingredients in personal care products). The revision of the Directive aims to require quaternary treatment for all larger plants, also based on an extended producer responsibility scheme that would help finance the corresponding treatment costs.
