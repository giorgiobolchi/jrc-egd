## The Water Reuse Regulation aim to encourage and facilitate water reuse in the EU by harmonised minimum water quality requirements for the safe reuse of treated urban wastewaters in agricultural irrigation. Further requirements are set for monitoring, risk management, transparency and permits
on production and supply of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation
Regulation 2020/741 (‘Water reuse Regulation’)

Thematic area: #TA7_Towards_a_zero_pollution_ambition_for_a_toxic_free_environment

Assessment: Before the introduction of the Regulation, the EU was not equipped with a legislative framework for water reuse. More than 40,000 million m3 of waste- water is treated in the EU every year but only the 2.4% is further treated to be reused. As of April 2024, water reuse for agricultural irrigation is allowed in most Member States. Some Member States, where freshwater resources are abundant and irrigation demand is low, have planned not to allow water reuse for irrigation in their countries. Some Member States have not yet made a final decision, as resource and infrastructure costs still are being evaluated (source: WISE Freshwater website).
