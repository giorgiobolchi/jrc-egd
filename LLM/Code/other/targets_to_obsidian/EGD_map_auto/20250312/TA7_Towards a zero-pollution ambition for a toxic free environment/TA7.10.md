## Improve soil quality by reducing chemical pesticidesâ€™ use by 50%, by 2030

Thematic area: #TA7_Towards_a_zero_pollution_ambition_for_a_toxic_free_environment

Assessment: Considering soil quality and pesticides, reduction of (more hazardous) pesticide concentration in soil due to increased organic farming (as well as other agricultural practices) and other farm-to-fork objectives. Under current legal limitations (28 kg of copper per hectare over 7 years), a potential risk of increased organic farming could be an accumulation of copper in soil.
