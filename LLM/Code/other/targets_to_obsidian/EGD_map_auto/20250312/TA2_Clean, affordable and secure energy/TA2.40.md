Assessment: The use of renewable hydrogen in Europe is negligible at the moment. This also includes industrial processes. Several initiatives at the European level such as Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs), and the Hydrogen Bank, are expected to kick- start production of renewable hydrogen at scale. Several of the financed initiatives are targeting the production of green steel and currently Europe has the highest number of projects aimed at using renewable hydrogen for the production of steel.
