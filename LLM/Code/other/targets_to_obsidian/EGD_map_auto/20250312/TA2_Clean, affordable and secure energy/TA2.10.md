## Member States shall set an indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology of at least 5% of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030.
RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413)

Assessment: Innovative technologies are defined as those that improve in at least one way comparable state-of-the-art renewable energy technologies or make exploitable a largely untapped renewable energy resource, involving a clear degree of risk,
in technological, market or financial terms, which is higher than the risk generally associated with comparable non-innovative technologies or activities. According to the Association of European Renewable Energy Research Centers (EUREC)
[73], the EUâ€™s industry is ready, in the right circumstances, to deploy innovative renewable energy technologies to a level likely to exceed 5%, including innovative technologies such as advanced photovoltaics, floating photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and solar thermal.
