## By 31 December 2025, each Member State shall agree to establish a framework for cooperation on joint projects with one or more other Member States for the production of renewable energy, subject to the following: by 31 December 2030, Member States shall endeavour to agree on establishing at least two joint projects; by 31 December 2033, Member States with an annual electricity consumption of more than 100 TWh shall endeavour to agree on establishing a third joint project.

Assessment: Joint projects allow for a cost-efficient deployment of renewable energy across Europe and contribute to market integration. Despite its potential, cooperation between Member States has been very limited, thus leading to suboptimal results in terms of efficiency in increasing renewable energy. There are a few projects under consideration and being planned, as well as some permitting and under construction. However, these are in localised areas across the EU and not homogeneously distributed between Member States.
