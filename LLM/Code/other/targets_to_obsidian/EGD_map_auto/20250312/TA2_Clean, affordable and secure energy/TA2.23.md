## Member States shall make efforts to collectively contribute to the indicative Union primary energy consumption target amounting to no more than 992.5 Mtoe in 2030.
Directive (EU) 2023/1791

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: In 2022, primary energy consumption in the EU reached 1257 Mtoe, a 4.1% decrease compared with 2021, moving closer to the 2030 target.
Following the decline registered in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic across sectors, EU primary energy consumption increased again in 2021. The year 2022 shows better results than in 2019, before the pandemic, when primary energy consumption was at 1354 Mtoe and 36.5% away from the target.
The 1257 Mtoe registered for primary energy consumption in 2022 was the second lowest level since 1990 (the first year for which data are available), and the lowest was in 2020 (1236 Mtoe).
According to the EC assessment of the NECPs, the current drafts would lead to a gap of 75 Mtoe from the 2030 target.
