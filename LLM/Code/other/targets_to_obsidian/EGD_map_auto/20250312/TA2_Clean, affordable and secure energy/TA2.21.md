Assessment: 14 Member States reported data on public buildings in their national energy
and climate progress reports (NECPRs). Missing data prevent drawing general conclusions or calculating aggregated data at the EU level. In terms of final energy, the short-term evolution indicates a general increase with some exceptions, such as the residential sector in Greece and Ireland. The first reporting deadline for the EED is at the end of 2024.
