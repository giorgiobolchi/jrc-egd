Assessment: This indicator compares agricultural income to average wages in the economy and provides an estimate of the average income opportunities
that a person would have outside of agriculture. It has increased from 31% to 52% between 2005 and 2021 at the EU level, reflecting a CAGR of 3% in this time frame. However, there are discrepancies among Member States. While in certain Member States, such as Hungary and
France, farmers' income compared to other wages in the economy has grown more than the EU average, in other Member States like Italy and
Belgium, have remained below the EU average or have shown a decreasing trend (e.g. Estonia and Austria). In addition, although the average farm income
per worker in the EU has steadily increased over the past decade (by 56% from 2013 to 2021), income levels do not only vary significantly across EU countries,
but also across the farming sector and farm size. In particular, farm economic size significantly influences income as higher costs per hectare associated with larger farms are
compensated by higher production, leading to greater overall profitability. Indicator: Farmers income compared to wages in the rest of the economy (Source: DG AGRI).
