Most Member States surpass the EU average. While countries such as France and Germany have the highest capital formation in agriculture, some Member States lag behind e.g. Czechia, Bulgaria and Estonia. In the EU, gross fixed capital formation in agriculture has increased from EUR 44 Billion in 2005 to EUR 68 Billion in 2022, corresponding to a CAGR of 2.8% and a 55% percentage increase.
