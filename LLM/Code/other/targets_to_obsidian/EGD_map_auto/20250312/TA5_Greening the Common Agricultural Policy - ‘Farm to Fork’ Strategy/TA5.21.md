Assessment: Indicator: Rural next generation access (NGA) broadband coverage, as a % of households (Source: DG DIGIT).
Next generation access broadband availability has significantly improved over the past decade, with the percentage of households having access increasing from 18% of rural households in 2013 to 73% in 2022. However, the objective of achieving 100% coverage by 2025 is at risk at the current pace. Most Member States remain above the EU average of 73%. However, despite showing growth in the last decade, some Member States such as France (2013: 16%, 2022: 59%), Poland (2013: 18%, 2022: 40%), and Croatia (2013: >1%, 2022: 52%), still lag behind.
