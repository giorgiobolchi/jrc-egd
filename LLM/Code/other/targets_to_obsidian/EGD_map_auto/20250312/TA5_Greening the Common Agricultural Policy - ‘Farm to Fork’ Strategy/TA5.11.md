Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: The impacts on global species richness due to the supply chain of food products consumed in the EU (produced either in the EU or in other world regions) have increased during the last decade. This results from increasing food consumption, as well as increasing consumption
of animal-based products. Main drivers of biodiversity loss are associated to land use and climate change impacts. Observed trends in consumption patterns are not expected to change to an extent to revert this trend by 2030. Indicator: Consumption Footprint - Food (biodiversity loss) (Source: JRC).
