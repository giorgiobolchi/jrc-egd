## Increase organic farming with the aim to achieve at least 25% of total farmland under organic farming by 2030
Target in Common with Biodiversity Strategy (see Thematic Area 6)

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment:  Indicator: Area under organic farming (% of the total utilised agricultural area) (Source: Eurostat). Moderate progress rate, but not enough to reach
the target by 2030. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 6.7% per year observed i.e. an increase from 5.6% to 9.1% (2012-2020), while 9.3% per year would be required to meet the target
