Assessment: EU diets are poorly aligned with dietary recommendations, as none of the EU Member States is on track to meet the dietary- related guidelines. In the EU, no country fulfils simultaneously the recommendations for healthy food consumption [185]: the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains nuts and seeds as well as milk and fish is lower than the recommended intake levels (when compared to either national food based dietary guidelines [186] or World Health Organization (WHO) and EAT-Lancet recommendations [187], [188]), while the consumption of red meat is above.
However, at the moment there is no adequate indicator available to assess the progress on this objective. The lack of regular, consistent and methodologically harmonised surveys across the EU Member States challenges the coverage and the comparability of such data, being an important gap for the use of these indicators. To overcome the lack of regularity and timeliness of the data, the development of food consumption indicators using data from national dietary surveys to monitor dietary components of healthy diets is being explored.
