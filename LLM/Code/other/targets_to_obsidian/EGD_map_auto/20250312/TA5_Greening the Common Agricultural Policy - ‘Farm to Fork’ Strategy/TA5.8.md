## Water: Preserving freshwater, boosting water reuse in agriculture.

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: Overall, using a 3-year moving average, the EU has seen a 14% improvement in the Water Exploitation Index (WEI+) compared to 2011. This improvement
was observed in 14 Member States. However, further improvements are necessary. Efforts are needed to reduce the inequality in total water use as a percentage of the
renewable freshwater resources between Member States, especially in the Mediterranean area. (Renewable freshwater resources in the WEI+ index are computed considering mainly a change in the water storage capacity (groundwater and surface water) of a given territory. For example, Cyprus had
a WEI+ of 113% in 2019, in contrast to France's 2.8%. Seven Member States recorded a WEI+ score of less than 1, indicating that their water storage capacity exceeded their consumption. Indicator: Water use in agriculture (Water exploitation index, plus - WEI+) (Source: EEA).
