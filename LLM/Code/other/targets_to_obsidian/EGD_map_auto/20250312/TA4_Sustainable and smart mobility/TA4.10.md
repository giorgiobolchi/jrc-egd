## EU fisheries are encouraged to continue the positive trend, as observed for the period 2009-2019, towards reducing fuel intensity by reducing the fossil-fuel consumption per kg of landed product for at least an additional 15% for the period 2019-2030.
Energy Transition of the EU Fisheries and Aquaculture sector

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: The Communication notes that "Fisheries and aquaculture operators began reducing their energy intensity between 2009 and 2014, but the progress they made has stagnated in recent years. Therefore, there is a need to accelerate the energy transition". In turn, this statement grounds on the JRC science for policy report "The 2022 Annual Economic Report on the EU Fishing Fleet‚Äù [161] by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, assessing that the sector fuel intensity (i.e. fuel consumption per tonne landed) dropped by more than 15% between 2009 and 2014, but that this trend has stagnated since then.
