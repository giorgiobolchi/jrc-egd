## Member States shall ensure that, at the end of each year, the following power output targets are met cumu- latively: (a) for each light-duty battery electric vehicle registered in their territory, a total power output of at least 1.3 kW is provided through publicly accessible recharging stations; and (b) for each light-duty plug-in hybrid vehicle registered in their territory, a total power output of at least 0.80 kW is provided through publicly accessible recharging stations.
Regulation (EU) 2023/1804

Assessment: Based on charging infrastructure data from Eco-Movement 2022 and estimates of electric vehicles on the roads, most Member States are already compliant with this fleet-based target (see European Alter-native Fuels Observatory â€“ Target tracker). Research also highlights that the total power output needed per electric vehicle (including battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles) is highly dependent on the share of electric cars and vans on the road, with AFIR targets on cumulative power outputs per vehicle being sufficient in the long term (when a rise in the market share of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles is expected) [157].
