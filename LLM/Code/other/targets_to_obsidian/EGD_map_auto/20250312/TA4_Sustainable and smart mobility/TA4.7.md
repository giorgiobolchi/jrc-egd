## Each Member State shall set an obligation on fuel suppliers to ensure that: (B) the combined share of advanced biofuels and biogas produced from the feedstock listed in Part A of Annex IX and of renewable fuels of non-biological origin in the energy supplied to the transport sector is at least 1% in 2025 and 5.5% in 2030, of which a share of at least 1 percentage point is from renewable fuels of non-biological origin in 2030. Directive (EU) 2023/2413

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: According to EurObservâ€™ER [155] the contribution of advanced biofuels already reached 1% in 2022 (indicative data). The target for 2025 has already been reached. Nevertheless, the sub-target for RFNBO of 1 percentage point for 2030 is not on track as of 2022 data, but the uptake of RFNBO is expected to grow in the coming years, providing enough time to reach the 2030 target.
