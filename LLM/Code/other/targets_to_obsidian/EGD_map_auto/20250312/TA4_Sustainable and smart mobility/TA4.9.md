## Cut the emissions of transport sector by 90% by 2050 relative to 1990.
Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: Following six years of steady growth in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU’s transport sector, transport emissions dropped substantially in 2020 because
of reduced activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 they were still 6% below 2019 levels. However, Eurostat quarterly GHG emission data shows that this rebound continued in 2023. According to the Report “Towards EU climate neutrality: progress, policy gaps and opportunities” by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change, the average rate of emission reduction since 2005 (-2 MtCO2e per year) should be more than 10 times higher (-26 MtCO2e
per year in 2023-2030) to be consistent with the trajectories towards the overall 2030 net GHG emission reduction target by the EU Climate Law. When considering the 90% reduction objective for transport GHG emissions by 2050, the average rate of emission reduction should be higher (-31 MtCO2e in 2031-2050).
