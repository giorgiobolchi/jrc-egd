Assessment: The EU has reached only 12% of MPA, with less than 1% being strictly protected. In addition, for sea bird species connectivity, it is important to align the BDS and the REPowerEU targets. For habitat connectivity, it is crucial to develop a useful indicator in time for Member States' reporting.
Because of the recent approval of the Nature Restoration Law, not enough data is available yet.
