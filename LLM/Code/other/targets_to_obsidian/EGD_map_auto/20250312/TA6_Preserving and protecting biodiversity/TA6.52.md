'Nature Restoration Law'
Parallel target of the Biodiversity Strategy: “4. By 2030, significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored. Habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trends and status; and at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend”

Assessment: After a steady decline over the period 1992-2010, common forest bird populations have stopped deteriorating and started showing some signs of recovery since 2010 [2], [207], [208]. Next data points for the common forest bird index will be crucial to confirm this recent increasing trend.
