## Marine ecosystems. Member States shall put in place [...] measures [...] to jointly cover, as a Union target, throughout the areas and ecosystems [...] defined in Art. 2, by 2030, at least 20% of sea areas in need of restoration and, by 2050, all ecosystems in need of restoration.
'Nature Restoration Law'

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: Data on restoration has not been systematically collected at the EU level yet.
The EU has reached 12% of Marine Protected Areas (MPA), with less than 1% being strictly protected. The target could be partially achieved if the NRL is imme- diately implemented (including a clear financial system), along with the targets
of the Biodiversity Strategy (i.e. 30% MPA and 10% strictly protected areas), and if Member States react in a timely manner. The complete achievement of the target also depends on the restoration methods used and the specific marine ecosystems to be restored. The recovery period length varies with the marine habitats targeted for restoration. In addition, Member States face several other challenges in implementing these strategies [205]. The actual implementation of the Biodiversity Strategy target on effective marine protected areas (30% overall and 10% strictly protected by 2030), through passive restoration methods, as well as the other directives such as the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and the 2023 Marine Action Plan would contribute to achieving this target.
