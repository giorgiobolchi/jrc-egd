## 1.a Legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU’s land area

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: The 26% of EU’s land area is covered by protected areas, including 18.6% by Natura 2000 designated protected areas and 17.3% by nationally designated protected areas. If the designation of protected areas continues at the rate seen in the past decade (1.7 percentage points increase since 2011), the target will not be met [209].
