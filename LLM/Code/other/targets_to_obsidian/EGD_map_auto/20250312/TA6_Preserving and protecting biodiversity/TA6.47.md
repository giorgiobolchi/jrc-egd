## (agricultural ecosystems) Member States shall put in place measures which shall aim to achieve an increasing trend at national level
of at least two out of the three following indicators in agricultural ecosystems, as further specified in Annex IV, measured in the period from the date of entry into force of this Regulation until 31 December 2030, and every six years thereafter, until the satisfactory levels, identified in accordance with Article 14(5), are reached: (a) grassland butterfly index; (b) stock of organic carbon in cropland mineral soils; (c) share of agricultural land with high-diversity landscape features. 'Nature Restoration Law'

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: At the moment the trend in the grassland butterfly index is still declining. The carbon stocks in EU agricultural soils have declined by 0.75% in the period 2009-2018 based on measured LUCAS data. So at the moment at least 2 out of three indicators are moving against the desired direction [199].
