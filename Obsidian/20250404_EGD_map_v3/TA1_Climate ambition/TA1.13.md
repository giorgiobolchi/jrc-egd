## No debit rule. For the period from 2021 to 2025, each Member State shall ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from the sector do not exceed greenhouse gas removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals on its territory in all the land accounting categories. The accounting benchmark for the EU is ca. -229 MtCO2e/year for 2021-2025 LULUCF Regulation

Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: Assessing the distance to the target is difficult. Comparing purely the GHG re- porting from countries for 2021 and 2022, to the accounting benchmark of -229 MtCO2e determined by the delegated act, it looks like the EU is slightly exceeding the accounting benchmark. However, the recalculations of the inventories have increased the net sink historical time series reported by the Member States, and those recalculations will be considered in the accounting. Given the sharp decline of the forest sink driven by increasing harvest levels and natural disturbances, it is likely that the EU will face an overall accounting debit (i.e. not reaching the target) than a credit in the LULUCF sector as a whole.
The reporting for years 2026-2029 will be done in GHG inventories during 2028- 2031.
