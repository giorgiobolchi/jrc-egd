## EU ETS. The contribution of the sectors covered by the existing EU Emission trading System (EU ETS) with respect to the EU Climate ambition should be of -62% compared to 2005 (increasing the linear emissions reduction factor from 2.2% per year up to 4.4%), by 2030
Directive (EU) 2023/959

Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: The decreasing trajectory of the number of CO2 emission allowances is expected to lead to -62% less CO2 emission in 2030 compared to 2005 levels. EU ETS emissions fell by 47% between 2005 and 2022. The most important driver for the decrease in EU ETS emissions has been the power sector, due to a substantial in- crease in renewable electricity production (primarily wind and solar) at the expense of both coal and gas. The system covers the electricity sector, large industry, and since 2012, aviation (initially intra-European Economic Area, with an upcoming extension of scope). Since 1 January 2024, it has been expanded to include the maritime sector [30]. The 2023 greenhouse gas emission projections reported by the Member States to the EEA [15], [22] result in a reduction of ETS emissions of 55% to 59% (with existing measures â€“ with additional measures projection) in
the ETS sectors in 2030. While these projections are short of the 62% target, it is important to note that, the ETS being an EU-wide market-based (cap and trade) instrument, this objective is not directly addressed by Member States specific policies and cannot be consistently and comprehensively covered by the individual Member States GHG emission projections.
Given that the ETS instrument is established and operational, and that the nec- essary technologies are both available and affordable, it is anticipated that the target can be achieved.
