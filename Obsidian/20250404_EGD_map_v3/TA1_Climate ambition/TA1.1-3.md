## Reduce by at least 55% net GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, by 2030

Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: The at least 55% economy-wide net reduction objective is enshrined in the Climate Law as an overall ambition at the EU level. Specific legislation covering different sectors translates this into sectoral ambition levels which cumulatively achieve the -55% target. This corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 62% in the existing ETS compared to 2005, a 40% reduction in ESR, (this is now complemented by 42% reduction target compared to 2005 in the newly established ETS2). With the aim of ensuring strong emissions reduction in other sectors, the overall contribution of the LULUCF sector to EU’s economy-wide target of − 55% by 2030 is limited to a maximum of − 225 MtCO2e/year. Achieving the LULUCF sector target of -310 MtCO2e in 2030 will elevate the total EU GHG emission reduction to approximately 57% compared to 1990. The total net EU greenhouse gases emissions, including LULUCF, were reduced by 32.5% between 1990 and 2022 [21]. GHG emission reductions need to double in the current decade compared to the previous decades (see charts in the annexes).
According to the Member States’ own projections reported in 2023 under Article 18 of the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation, total EU emissions are expected to fall in 2030 by about 50% below the 1990 level when factoring in additional measures. This falls short of the at least 55% objective, but the Member States projections do not accurately capture the evolution driven by EU-wide instruments such as the ETS.
Reaching the -55 % objective further depends on delivery of ESR, which is not fully on track, as well as the related functioning of ETS2. In addition, the -55% objective assumes that the LULUCF sink is at least -225 MtCO2e. The agreed LULUCF commitment of -310 MtCO2e could even achieve -57%. However, the current development of the LULUCF sink is opposite to the targets, including natural disturbances that are expected to further increase with the ongoing climate change [27], [28]. If this negative development continues, the risk of not reaching the sink of –225 MtCO2 cannot be ruled out.
On the other hand, the implementation of the complete Fit for 55 legislative package is expected to reduce EU net greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2030, putting EU on track to exceed 2030 targets [29].
On the way to climate neutrality by 2050, the Commission adopted a Communica- tion [23] in February 2024 that launches the process of setting the 2040 climate target for the EU, in compliance with Art. 4.3 of the Climate Law. While 2040 targets are not yet set, it is clear that much of the transition to 2050 has to be realised
by 2040. Based on the recommended emission reductions of 90-95 % by 2040 compared to 1990, of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change advised, the Commission has recommended a net 90% GHG reduction target for 2040.
Both 2040 and 2050 targets require a much deeper transformation of the energy system, through large scale deployment of climate-neutral technologies that require high investment efforts with some technologies not yet deployed at market scale. While some of the current instruments will keep delivering reductions well beyond 2030 (notably the EU ETS but also CO2 standards for vehicles, ReFuelEU Aviation, FuelEU Maritime and the Fluorinated gas (F-gas) Regulation), there will be a need
to review, update and complete the legislative framework for the post-2030 period. This will include topics such as carbon capture, industrial carbon removals, and overall and sector specific emission reduction trajectories. In addition, larger emis- sion reductions in difficult-to-abate sectors like agriculture will be needed, along with a larger role for carbon removals, including utilising land as a carbon sink.
