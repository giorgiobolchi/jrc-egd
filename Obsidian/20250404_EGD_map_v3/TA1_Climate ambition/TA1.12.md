## Achieve an EU net greenhouse gas removal of 310 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, by 2030, and Member State-specific targets for 2030 summing up to -42 MtCO2e increase in LULUCF sink between 2016-2018 and 2030.

Thematic area: #TA1_Climate_ambition

Assessment: The revised LULUCF regulation sets a target of removing 310 MtCO2e by 2030. The long-term EU forest sink is developing away from this target and jeopard- ising the fulfilment of the overall LULUCF sector target for 2030. Furthermore, natural disturbances are expected to increase with ongoing climate change, with potentially a further reduction of the carbon sink, making the situation even more difficult.
In 2020, the gap between the reported LULUCF emissions in 2016-2018 and the target of -310 MtCO2e for 2030 was -42 MtCO2e for the EU. 2024 shows that this gap has now widened: instead of -42 MtCO2e, the EU needs to improve its LULUCF sink by -80 MtCO2e between 2022 and 2030 to meet the targets. The LULUCF targets will be difficult to achieve unless substantial changes in forest manage- ment are implemented very soon.
