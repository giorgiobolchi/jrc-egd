## The Ambient Air Quality Directives set EU air quality standards for 12 air pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide / nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), ozone, benzene, lead, carbon monoxide, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, and benzo(a)pyrene. The Directives take into account relevant World Health Organisation standards, guidelines and programmes. The Directives also guide the assessment of air quality by establishing a representative high-quality monitoring network, with more than 4.000 air quality monitoring stations across the EU, and by exchanging reliable, objective, comparable information on air quality, including to a wider public. Where levels are elevated above limit or target values, Member States should prepare an air quality plan or programme to address the sources responsible to ensure compliance and to keep exceedance periods as short as possible. In addition, information on air quality should be disseminated to the public.

Assessment: In the European Union, air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk, causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that lead to the loss of healthy years of life and, in the most serious cases, premature deaths (about 240 000 reported in the European Union (EU) for 2021). Although emissions of air pollutants have been reduced over recent decades (primarily as a result of legislation), air quality remains a major concern in many parts of Europe. Air quality limits set by EU legislation for particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone continue to be exceeded, especially in many urban areas.
