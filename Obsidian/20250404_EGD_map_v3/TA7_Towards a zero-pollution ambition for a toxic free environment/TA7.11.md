## Improve soil quality by reducing nutrient losses use by 50%, by 2030

Thematic area: #TA7_Towards_a_zero_pollution_ambition_for_a_toxic_free_environment

Assessment: Considering water quality and nutrient losses, there is a possible reduction of nutrient inputs into marine ecosystems: nitrogen 32%, phosphorous 17%. 50% reduction of nutrient input could be achieved in four out of ten examined regions for nitrogen and in two out of ten for phosphorous.

Considering water quality and chemical pesticides, and in particular chemicals load (diuron and terbuthylazine, as examples of low- and high-persistence chemicals, respectively) in water: 56% reduction in pesticides concentration can be achieved in shelf seas, 12% in open seas, depending on the persistence of the pesticide.
