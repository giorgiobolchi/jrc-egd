## Reduce by 25% the EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity, by 2030 (compared to 2005) (2030 target contributing to the 2050 ambition of a toxic-free environment)


Thematic area: #TA7_Towards_a_zero_pollution_ambition_for_a_toxic_free_environment

Assessment: Current and proposed EU policies do not appear sufficient to enable the EU to reduce the area of EU ecosystems under threat from air pollution by 25% in 2030 compared to 2005. Nonetheless, with the implementation of the recently revised of the Ambient Air Quality Directives, this target could be achieved. Source: Zero Pollution Outlook [218].
