## Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that water intended for human consumption is wholesome and clean, by meeting several requirements related to micro-organisms and parasites which constitute a potential danger to human health and quality standards recalled in the Directive.
Directive 2020/2184 (‘Drinking Water Directive)

Thematic area: #TA7_Towards_a_zero_pollution_ambition_for_a_toxic_free_environment

Assessment: The level of access to clean drinking water in Europe is high according to the WASH database by the WHO and UNICEF. However, as reported by the EEA,
the levels of treatment and accessibility are lower in rural areas than in urban locations. Disparities in access to safe drinking water among ethnic groups in Europe emerged as well. The revised Drinking Water Directive includes additional parameters than the 46 microbiological, chemical and indicator parameters of the first Drinking Water Directive. The new parameters include per- and polyfluorinated compounds and bisphenol A, setting limit values for their presence in drinking water. As of the end of 2022, EU level data on drinking water quality were still limited, with the latest data available dating from 2011 and 2013. The new directive also foresees a watch list mechanism for emerging pollutants.
The Directive’s Impact Assessment includes the calculation of the “SAPEA” Popu- lation Potentially at Health Risk indicator, estimating the share of the population that could potentially suffer from health problems because of the presence of contaminants in drinking water. According to the indicator, in 2015, 22.7 million people were potentially at health risk due to non-safe drinking water, equivalent
to 4 % of the EU population. The revised Directive is expected to positively impact drinking water quality. However, estimated data for 2015 is not sufficient to assess the status of drinking water quality with respect to its evolution over time and new additional parameters by the revised directive, as confirmed by the EEA. Member States have started complying with the reporting requirements in 2023.
