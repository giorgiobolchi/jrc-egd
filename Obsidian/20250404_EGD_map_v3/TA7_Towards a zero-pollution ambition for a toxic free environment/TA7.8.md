## The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) aims at preventing or reducing emissions from large industrial installations and intensive farming into the environment. The revised IED includes new provisions related to resource, energy and water efficiency and to the reduction of use and emissions of hazardous substances. The scope has been widened to include metal mining, batteries giga-factories, waste landfills and intensive farming. The revised IED contains also a set of measures to facilitate and accelerate the uptake of innovative techniques by industry.

Assessment: The IED is a key instrument to support the transition of the EU industry towards a climate neutral, clean and circular economy. The revised legislation will lead to a considerable reduction of pollution from industry and level the playing field. For example, it is expected to deliver, latest by 2050, up to 40% additional reduction of key air pollutants.
