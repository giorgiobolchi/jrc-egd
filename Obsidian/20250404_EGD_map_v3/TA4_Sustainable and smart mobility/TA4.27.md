## Member States shall ensure that, by 31 December 2030 (with intermediate 2025 and 2027 targets), along the TEN-T core road network, publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles are deployed in each direction of travel
with a maximum distance of 60 km between them [...]. Along the TEN-T comprehensive road network, recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles are deployed in each direction of travel with a maximum distance of 100 km between them and each recharging pool offers a power output of at least 1.500 kW and includes at least one recharging point with an individual power output of at least 350 kW. Regulation (EU) 2023/1804

Thematic area: #TA4_Sustainable_and_smart_mobility

Assessment: Despite the lack of specific data regarding recharging pools for heavy-duty electric vehicles, the extent of the TEN-T network served by high voltage recharging points stays so far limited to central Europe, with significant infrastructure improvement needed in Southern and Eastern EU, alongside the core and comprehensive networks (see TENtec Interactive Map Viewer).
