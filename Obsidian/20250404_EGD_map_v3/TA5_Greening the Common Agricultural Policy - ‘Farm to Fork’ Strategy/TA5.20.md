## Trade: Foster the competitiveness of the EU supply sector.

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: The EU agri-food trade balance has shown stable growth over the last twenty years, despite a marginal decrease in 2022. It has reached a record level in 2023, with a total surplus of EUR 70.1 billion. While the overall agri-food trade balance shows a surplus, there are variations at the category level. The EU has a trade deficit in several product categories, with the most significant deficits observed in oilseeds
and protein crops, and some fruits and nuts. The surplus is spread across product categories, driven mainly by cereal preparations, dairy products, and wine.
