Assessment: Indicator: Sales of antimicrobials for food producing animals (Source: EMA). According to the 13th European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption report, the overall sales of antimicrobials for use in food-producing animals within the EU have fallen between 2018 and 2022 by 28.3%.
