## Food availability: Improve availability of sustainable food. Ensure that the healthy option is always the easiest one. Ensure food supply.

Assessment: The ratio plant to total protein supply indicator is derived from FAO supply data. The closer the value is to 1, the higher the contribution of plant-based sources to protein supply; the average of the previous three years is taken to reduce error variation. This indicator examines the contribution of plant food sources
to total protein (animal and plant) supply and can inform on the transition towards more plant-based food diets based on food supply data. Since 2012, a slight decrease has been observed across most EU countries (between 1 and 5%). The average ratio for the EU region has slightly decreased from 0.42 to 0.40 between 2012 and 2020. This change indicates that a transition towards increased supply of plant-based foods in the EU remains a challenge, possibly linked to a slow progress in the transition towards more plant-based diets in the region.
