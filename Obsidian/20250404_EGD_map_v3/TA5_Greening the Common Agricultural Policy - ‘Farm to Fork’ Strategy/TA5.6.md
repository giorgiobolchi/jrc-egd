## Aquatic living resources: Increase sustainable fishing and aquaculture. Bring fish stocks to sustainable levels. Significant increase in organic aquaculture

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: This is the objective of the CFP to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally sustainable and managed in a manner consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits. This indicator shows the modelled average ratio of fishing mortality to its associated reference point (FMSY or its proxy) over time since 2003. It monitors the trend of F/FMSY at the level of European waters (Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea). The aim is to have a decreasing trend (as the starting point was 1.56) and to reach the lowest possible level below 1. A downward trend was observed throughout the time series, thus showing an improvement in the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks. Although the indicator
in 2021 stands at 0.88, lower values are expected in case of full sustainable exploitation since some stocks are still overfished (F>FMSY). Indicator: Fishing pressure relative to maximum sustainable yield (trends in F/ FMSY) (Source: JRC).
