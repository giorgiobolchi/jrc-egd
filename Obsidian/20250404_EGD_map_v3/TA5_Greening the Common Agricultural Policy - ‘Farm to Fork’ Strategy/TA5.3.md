## Reduce nutrient losses by at least 50%, while ensuring that there is no deterioration in soil fertility.

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: Indicator: Nitrate in groundwater (Source: EEA).
The EU aggregate for nitrate content in groundwater based on 18 Member States shows a positive trend (â€“0.7% annual growth rate) between 2015 and 2020. However, this slight reduction is still far away from the 50% aimed by 2030. It should be noted that the long-term trend (2005-2020) for the EU aggregate was rather stagnant (0.003% annual growth rate).
