## Energy: Increase renewable energy in the agriculture and food sector.
Adopt energy efficiency solutions in the agriculture and food sector, by
reducing energy consumption.

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: Overall, there has been an increase in energy consumption for both agriculture and forestry, as well as the overall food industry,
by 7.4 % and 13.5% respectively compared to 2011. The annual rate of increase
is 0.8% for agriculture and forestry and 1.7% for the food industry. Across Europe,
these two sectors have consumed 54.32 million tonnes of oil equivalent, evenly split between them. France and Germany lead in total energy consumption. For the overall
food industry, there has been a noticeable decrease of 1% in France, while Germany experienced an increase of 5.8% compared to 2011. In agriculture and forestry, France and the Netherlands lead in energy consumption, with increases of 1.3% and 9.9%, respectively. Consequently, efforts are required to enhance energy efficiency and achieve the objective of reducing energy consumption at the EU level.
