## Food affordability: Ensure affordability to sufficient, nutritious and sustainable food

Thematic area: #TA5_Greening_the_Common_Agricultural_Policy

Assessment: The percentage of population who cannot afford a healthy diet is reported by FAO and the World Bank for global monitoring. A healthy diet is considered unaffordable when its cost exceeds 52% of income per capita per day. This percentage accounts for a portion of income that can be credibly reserved for food, based on observations that the population in low-income countries spend, on average, 52% of their income on food. The estimated proportion of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet in Europe has dropped 40% from 2.5% in 2017 to 1.5% in 2021. Across EU countries, values ranged between <1% for several countries and 7% in Romania in 2021. The indicator does not account for non-food spending and likely underestimates food affordability issues in the context of the EU region. Indicator: Percent of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet in the EU (Source: FAO).
