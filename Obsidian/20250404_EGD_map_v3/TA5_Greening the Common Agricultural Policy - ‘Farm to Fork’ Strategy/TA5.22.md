Since 2013, approximately 30% of the freight of food products, beverages and tobacco has been transported less than 50 km, and another 30% has been transported between 50 and 150 km. Between 2013 and 2021, the tonnes per kilometre transported for all activities related to the food system (agriculture, fisheries, food manufacturing, trade and services) have increased by 9%, although the tonnes per kilometre transported in the food and beverages manufacturing sector decreased by 5%.
