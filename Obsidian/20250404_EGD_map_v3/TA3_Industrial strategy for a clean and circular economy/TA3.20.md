## Recycling shall achieve at least the following targets for recycling efficiency:
No later than 31 December 2025
- 75% by average weight of lead-acid batteries;
- 80% by average weight of nickel-cadmium batteries - 50% by average weight of other waste batteries
No later than 31 December 2030
- 80% by average weight of lead-acid batteries; Regulation (EU) 2023/1542

Assessment: Based on current draft guidance for calculation and verification rules for recycling efficiency, the targets for lead-acid, nickel-cadmium and other waste batteries are feasible.
Since, for lead-acid batteries, the battery chemistry and related recycling technologies are fully mature and efficient. For both nickel-cadmium and other waste batteries, it will be important to monitor the performances due to the evolving market for these chemistries.
