## At least 25% of the target set out in the first subparagraph shall be achieved by including plastics recycled from end-of-life vehicles in the vehicle type concerned.
Proposal for a Regulation on circularity requirements for vehicle design and on management of end-of-life vehicles

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: Although the calculation method has not been defined, JRC assumes that this feature of the targets is in principle reachable. JRC highlights that they require significant innovations in the industrial production systems both in the production and uptake of high-quality recycled plastics, in particular in the area of end-of-life vehicle collection and treatment and wide deployment of post-shredder sorting technologies.
