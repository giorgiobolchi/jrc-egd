## Reduce the generation of food waste in processing and manufacturing by 10% in comparison to the amount generated in 2020
Proposal amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: Data for these targets is only available for 2020 and for 2021 in Eurostat, therefore it is still early to define a clear trend. However, based on the analysis performed in the impact assessment of the Proposal for a Directive amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste [108], it is possible to estimate that the target is feasible, but progress needs to accelerate to reach the target value.
