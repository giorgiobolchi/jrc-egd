## Member States shall take the necessary measures to attain a recycling target of 50% of aluminium by weight of aluminium contained in packaging waste generated by 31 December 2025 and of 60% by 31 December 2030
Proposal on packaging and packaging waste

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: Similarly for aluminium, the high recycling rates registered for metallic packaging suggest that both recycling targets are achievable, at least at the EU level2. Nonetheless, 9 Member States are at risk of missing the 2025 target, including Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Greece, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain [125].
