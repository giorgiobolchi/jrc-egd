## Recycling shall achieve at least the following targets for recycling efficiency:
- No later than 31 December 2025, 65% by average weight of lithium-based batteries;
- No later than 31 December 2030, 70% by average weight of lithium-based batteries.

Assessment: The 2025 target for lithium-based batteries is in principle feasible, however due to the increasing diversity of lithium-based batteries on the market, it is important to closely monitor the performance towards the target. Furthermore, there are some improvement opportunities when data is available, recycling systems are established and when the target is revised by 2027.
