## By 2030, Union extraction capacity should be able of extracting the ores, minerals or concentrates needed to produce at least 10% of the Union’s annual consumption of strategic raw materials, to the extent possible in light of the Union’s reserves.
Regulation (EU) 2024/1252

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: The historical time trends (2011-2022) for EU self-sufficiency at extraction phase for the 16 strategic materials can be extracted based on data from [121], [122] and [123]. Results show that:
- In 2022, cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel were above the benchmark of 10%, while their trends have been stably above the benchmark (i.e. copper and nickel) or increased slightly in the period 2011-2022 (i.e. cobalt and lithium)1.
- For bismuth, boron, gallium, germanium, magnesium, natural graphite, titanium, platinum group metals, heavy rare earth elements and light rare earth elements, the EU’s self-sufficiency has always been below 2%.
- Between 2016 and 2022, the EU’s self-sufficiency for manganese was below the benchmark, with values ranging from 4 to 10% in the time frame 2016-2022.
1 Due to high volatility on the data for tungsten (only two date points available from EC studies), this material is not included in the analysis.
