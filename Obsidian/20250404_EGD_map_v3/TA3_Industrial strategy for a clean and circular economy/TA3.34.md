Proposal on packaging and packaging waste

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: Considering the high recycling rates for metallic packaging at the EU level2, the 2025 and 2030 recycling targets seem achievable. However, 5 Member States are at risk of missing the 2025 target, including Croatia, Denmark, Malta, Portugal and Romania [125].
