## Reduce the generation of food waste per capita, jointly in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services and in households, by 30% in comparison to the amount generated in 2020 Proposal amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: Data for these targets is only available for 2020 and for 2021 in Eurostat, therefore it is still early to define a clear trend. However, based on the analysis performed in the impact assessment of the Proposal for a Directive amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste [108], it is possible to estimate that the target is feasible, but progress needs to accelerate to reach the target value.
