Proposal on packaging and packaging waste

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: Currently, there are no official statistics on the recycled content in plastic packaging, due to the lack of EU guidelines on calculating and reporting recycled content. As of 2022, there is no recycled content in food-contact (non-PET) plastic packaging, 20% in PET packaging and 14% for other plastic packaging [126], [127]. These recycled content rates are still far away from the 2030 targets of 10%, 30% and 35% for each plastic packaging category, respectively.
