## Producers of portable batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall attain, and maintain durably,
at least the following collection targets for waste portable batteries:
- 45% by 31 December 2023; - 63% by 31 December 2027; - 73% by 31 December 2030. Regulation (EU) 2023/1542

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: The calculation methodology is under development and these targets will be updated accordingly, whilst maintaining the same level of ambition.
Currently, there is no robust data to assess the distance to the targets (e.g. due to new types of batteries entering in the markets, longer lifetime of batteries, new applications).
Assuming the ambition of the targets, attention might be paid in the implementa- tion phase at Member State level.
