## By 2030, Union recycling capacity, including forall intermediate recycling steps, should be able
of producing at least 25% of the Unionâ€™s annual consumption of strategic raw materials and should be able of recycling significantly increasing amounts of each strategic raw material from waste.
Regulation (EU) 2024/1252

Thematic area: #TA3_Industrial_strategy_for_a_clean_and_circular_economy

Assessment: The historical trends of the recycling capacity for strategic materials can be assessed by looking at the evolution of the End-of-Life Recycling Input Rate of strategic materials over time. Out of 16 strategic materials, the recycling capacity: - was above the 25% benchmark in 2022 for two materials (copper and tungsten), - was between 22% and 5% in 2022 for eight materials groups (cobalt, magnesium, manganese, nickel, titanium, platinum group metals, and both heavy and light rare earth elements)
- was below 5% for six materials (bismuth, boron, gallium, germanium, lithium and natural graphite)
