## 7. At least 10% of agricultural area is under high-diversity landscape features Biodiversity Strategy

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: The JRC has developed an indicator [212] to monitor progress in the share of agricultural area covered by landscape features, showing that currently, at the EU level, 5.6% of agricultural land is covered by landscape features. However, this indicator does not capture high-diversity landscape features and no temporal trend is available, so at this stage no conclusion can be made regarding the likelihood to reach the target.
