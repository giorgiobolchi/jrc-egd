## ecosystems. Member States shall put in place the restoration measures that are necessary to re-establish the habitat types of groups 1-6 listed in Annex II in areas not covered by those habitat types with the aim to reach their favourable reference area. Such measures shall be in place on areas representing at least 30% of the additional overall surface needed to reach the total favourable reference area of each group of habitat types, as quantified in the national restoration plan referred to in Article 12, by 2030, at least 60% of that surface by 2040, and 100% of that surface by 2050.

Assessment: Considering the last report on the conservation status and trend in conservation status of marine habitats, most of the marine areas are between categories UNFAVOURABLE (U1/U2) and UNKNOWN (XX) status.
There are some examples of restoration measures already put in place across European Sea, but without an immediate implementation of NRL, as well as other directives (e.g. BDBS, WFD, MSFD), the EGD target would not be achieved Additional observation: As mentioned before, marine restoration can be achieved passively by no take MPA. Therefore, the increase in area that is fully protected would be a reasonable indicator of restoration. To the best of available knowledge, there is no evidence that part-protection works. Evidence of recovered species usually appear within five years but full recovery e.g. of urchin-kelp trophic cascades, may take 20 years. Since restoration is by definition a return to fully natural conditions, partly protected areas do not qualify as restoration.
Regarding the condition and restoration of marine areas, there are only two ways to judge this: (a) comparison with old, large fully protected MPA, and (b) the use of indicators, some of which still need to be developed. There is no data on how impacted most areas are, but indicators such as current fishing activities altering food webs, or bottom trawling and dredging destroying benthic habitats, would contribute to the final assessment. However, the precautionary principle should be applied, assuming marine ecosystems everywhere are impacted unless evidence suggests otherwise.
