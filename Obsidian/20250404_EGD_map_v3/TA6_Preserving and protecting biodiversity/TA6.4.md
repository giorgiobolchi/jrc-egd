## 2b. Strictly protect all remaining EU primary and old- growth forests
Biodiversity Strategy
Target in common with the New EU Forest Strategy

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: The target has been welcomed and endorsed by the European Council, which is key for this target. The Commission issued Guidelines [211]for defining, mapping, monitoring and strictly protecting EU Primary and Old-Growth Forests in 2023. However, there is still a lack of a clear, uniform definition of what constitutes primary and old-growth forests. As a result, while it is likely that the target will be met, it remains unclear whether all forests that should be protected will actually receive protection.
