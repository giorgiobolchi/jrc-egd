## 2.a Strictly protect at least a third of the EU'S protected areas

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: Indicators are missing to check whether the EU is on track or not. Seven out of
the nine actions set in the EU BDS to foster biodiversity protection in the EU still need to be implemented by 2030, but they all appear on track so far. Member States did not report official information reported to EEA. An independent scientific assessment [210] shows that currently only 3.5 % of protected areas are strictly protected.
