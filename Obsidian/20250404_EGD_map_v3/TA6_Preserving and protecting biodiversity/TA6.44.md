## Marine ecosystems. Member States shall put in place the restoration measures [...] to improve [...] areas of habitat types listed in Annex II which are not in good condition. Such measures shall be in place: (a) on at least 30% by 2030 of the total area of groups 1–6 of habitat types listed in Annex II [...]; (b) on at least 60% by 2040 and on at least 90% by 2050 of the area of each of the groups 1–6 of habitat types listed in An- nex II [...]; (c) on at least two thirds of the percentage, referred to in point (d), by 2040 of the area of group 7 of habitat types listed in Annex II [...]

Assessment: The EU has reached only 12% of MPA, with less than 1% being strictly protected. The target could be partially achieved if the NRL is immediately implemented (including a clear financial system), along with the targets of the Biodiversity Strategy (i.e. 30% MPA and 10% strictly protected areas), and if Member States react in a timely manner.
The complete achievement of the target is strictly dependent on the restoration methods and selected marine ecosystems to be restored. The timescale of the recovery period varies as diverse are the marine habitats to restore. Beyond this there are other challenges that Member States have to face [205].
The actual implementation of the BDS target on effective marine protected areas (30% overall and 10% strictly protected by 2030), through passive restoration method, as well as the other directives (e.g. WFD and MSFD), and the 2023 Marine Action Plan would contribute to achieve this target.
Regarding the condition and restoration, there are only two ways to judge this: (a) comparison with old large fully protected MPA, and (b) the use of indicators, some of which still need to be developed. There is no data on how impacted most areas are, but indicators such as present fishing activities altering food webs, or bottom trawling and dredging destroying benthic habitats, would contribute to the final assessment. However, the precautionary principle should be applied, assuming marine ecosystems everywhere are impacted unless evidence suggests otherwise.
