## (pollinator) Member States shall, by putting in place in a timely manner appropriate and effective measures, improve pollinator diversity and reverse the decline of pollina- tor populations at the latest by 2030 and thereafter achieve an increasing trend of pollinator populations, measured at least every six years from 2030, until satisfactory levels are achieved, as set in accordance with Article 14(5).
'Nature Restoration Law'
Parallel target of the Biodiversity Strategy: “5. The decline of pollinators is reversed”

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: Based on trends in the grassland butterfly index, pollinators are still declining. Another indicator that would include more pollinators is under development to better characterise the decline of pollinators.
