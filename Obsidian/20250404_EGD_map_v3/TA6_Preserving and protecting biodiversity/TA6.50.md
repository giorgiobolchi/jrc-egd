## (trees) When identifying and implementing the restoration measures to meet the objectives and obligations set out in Articles 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, Member States shall aim to contribute to the commitment of planting at least three billion additional trees by 2030 at Union level. 'Nature Restoration Law'
Parallel target of the Biodiversity Strategy: “9. Three billion trees are planted in the EU, in full respect of ecological principles”

Thematic area: #TA6_Preserving_and_protecting_biodiversity

Assessment: At the time of writing (mid-2024), over 23.000.000 trees have been planted since 2021 (see the Live Status Counter for EU dashboard). The pace of new trees planted has to massively speed up to reach the target by 2030.
