## The strategy sets targets for an installed capacity of at least 1 GW of ocean energy by 2030 and 40 GW by 2050
An EU offshore Renewable Energy Strategy

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: In 2023, the EU Member States installed in the order of 700 kW of
ocean energy (compared to 150 kW in 2022) and the cumulative ocean energy capacity in European sea basins is 43.8 MW. While there has been a positive increase in installations in the last year, the rate of annual installed capacity should still grow substantially to reach the 2030 target. Strong acceleration is needed.
