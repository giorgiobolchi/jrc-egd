## Member States are required to achieve cumulative end-use energy savings from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to new annual savings of at least 0.8% of final energy consumption in 2021-2023, at least 1.3% in 2024-2025, 1.5% in 2026-2027 and 1.9% in 2028-2030. Directive (EU) 2023/1791

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: The directive requires EU countries to set indicative national energy efficiency targets based on final energy consumption contributions to meet the Unionâ€™s target. This requirement is cumulative, meaning that Member States must sustain the annual savings achieved in one year over the following years, until the end of the obligation period in 2030.
Member States can spread the savings over the obligation period, as long as they achieve the required cumulative amount of savings at the end of the period. The progressive increase is equivalent to a flat rate of 1.49% over 2024-2030, which is almost a doubling of the current ambition level.
