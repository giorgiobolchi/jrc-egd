## Member States shall collectively ensure a reduction of energy consumption of at least 11.7% in 2030 compared to the projections of the 2020 EU Reference Scenario so that the Unionâ€™s final energy consumption amounts to no more than 763 Mtoe.
Directive (EU) 2023/1791

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: Final energy consumption reached 940 Mtoe in 2022, a 2.8% decrease compared with 2021. According to the EC assessment of the NECPs, the current Member States drafts pledges would lead to 5.8% energy efficiency improvements in 2030, compared to the target of 11.7%. Therefore, acceleration is needed to reach the 2030 target.
