## Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Unionâ€™s gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 42.5%. RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413)

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: In 2022, renewable energy represented 23.0 % of energy consumed in the EU, up
from 21.9% in 2021. This EU-level target has not been translated into binding national contributions. The target is to be achieved jointly by all Member States, building on their coordinated and combined action. According to the EC assessment of the draft NECPs, the current drafts would lead to a share of 38.6-39.3% of renewables in the energy mix by 2030. Reaching the 2030 target of 42.5% (and even more so the aspirational target of 45%) will require a much faster growth in the coming years.
