## Cumulative EU offshore goals of installed capacity: 60 GW by 2030 and 300 GW by 2050
An EU offshore Renewable Energy Strategy

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: In 2023, the cumulative installed capacity for wind offshore was on the order of 19 GW (it was 16.2 GW in 2022). Annual installation rate grew from 1.2 GW/year to around 3GW/year. A substantial increase is required in annual installations to reach 60 GW by 2030 (about twice the increase rate). Additionally, Member States have agreed to a new more ambitious non-binding target of reaching 111 GW by 2030 and 317 GW by 2050.
