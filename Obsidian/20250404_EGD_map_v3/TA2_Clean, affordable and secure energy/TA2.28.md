## Reduce buildingsâ€™ energy consumption for heating and cooling by 18% compared to 2015 levels by 2030
A Renovation Wave for Europe

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: The reference value for 2015 is 234 Mtoe. In 2021, FEC for space heating and cooling buildings was 247.2 Mtoe, obtained from adding FEC for space heating residential + FEC for air conditioning residential (only electricity) + FEC for space heating services + FEC for air conditioning = 170.72 + 1.01 + 64.9 + 10.6 = 247.2 Mtoe (data from [75]). Consumptions increased by 5.6% (2015-2021), instead of reducing.
Data for 2022 has not been published yet, however an estimate can be provided based on the 2015-2021 average share of services FEC for space heating and air conditioning to total services FEC (56%).
2022 FEC for space heating and cooling buildings = FEC for space heating residential + FEC for air conditioning residential (only electricity) + FEC for space heating and air conditioning services = 159.4 + 1.1 + 68.0 = 228 Mtoe. Consumptions expected to decrease by 1.3% (2015-2022).
