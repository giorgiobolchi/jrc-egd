Assessment: Two Member States (Malta and Sweden) have already reached their 2030 target. 18 Member States have achieved the 2022 target of 18%. However, in 2021, 10 Member States experienced a decline in their share respect their 2020 value. This occurred as well for seven Member States in 2022; nevertheless, two of them have still met their 2022 targets despite the decrease. The EU jointly has reached the 2022 sub-target.
