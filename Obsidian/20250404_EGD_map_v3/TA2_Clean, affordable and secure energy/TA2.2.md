EU Solar Energy Strategy

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: For the 2010-2021 period, energy communities in the EU were still a niche in most national energy markets, with an estimated 9250 energy communities currently in operation across the EU and highly unbalanced distribution among Member States. More than half of these are located in Germany and almost 1000 are in the Netherlands. To date, however, a systematic and cross-country database on citizen-led initiatives and projects is lacking [74].
