## The national measures will have to ensure that at least 55% of the decrease of the average primary energy use is achieved through the renovation of the worst-performing buildings.
EPBD (Directive (EU) 2024/1275)

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: Member States use different approaches to define their worst performing stock, such as energy class, age, energy consumption, as resulted by the analysis of the last long term building renovation strategies. In the NECPR, a total of 6 countries defined worst performance according the primary or final energy consumption in kWh/m2, while no information was found in 12 other countries. The fields on worst performing buildings have generally a lower completeness in the NECPRs
