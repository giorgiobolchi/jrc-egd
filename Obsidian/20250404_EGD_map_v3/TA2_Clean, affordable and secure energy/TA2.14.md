## Each Member State shall increase the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector by at least 0.8 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the period 2021 to 2025 and by at least 1.1 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the period 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of renewable energy in the sector in 2020. RED III (Directive (EU) 2023/2413)

Assessment: Energy for heating and cooling makes up around half of the EUâ€™s total gross final energy consumption. The annual average increases would lead to a target of 32.48% share by 2030. In 2022, the share of energy from renewables in heating and cooling continued to rise, with the EU average standing at 24.8%, up 1.8 percentage points from 2021 (23.0%). However, the 2022 value is still below the expected annual average. In absolute terms, the gross final consumption
of renewable energy for heating and cooling purposes in the EU has gradually increased over time, mostly due to the contribution of biomass and heat pumps. However, a major push is required to meet the 2030 target.
Sweden led the way when it came to renewables in heating and cooling, with a 69.3% share, followed by Estonia (65.4%). Both countries use mostly biomass and heat pumps. They are followed by Latvia (61.0%), which relies mostly on biomass.
