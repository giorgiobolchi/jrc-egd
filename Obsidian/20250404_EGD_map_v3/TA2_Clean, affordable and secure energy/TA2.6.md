## Energy demand to be covered by solar heat and geothermal should at least triple (rate is currently at 1.5%)
EU Solar Energy Strategy

Thematic area: #TA2_Clean_affordable_and_secure_energy

Assessment: Share should be 4.5% by 2030. In 2021, the relative size of solar thermal in overall heat consumption was 0.687 TWh (0.1%), over the total of 651 TWh. According to EurObserv'ER, there was a 10% growth in 2022, while the required annual rate growth is 12% to reach the target.
